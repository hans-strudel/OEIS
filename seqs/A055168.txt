%N A055168 Cumulative counting sequence: method B (noun,adjective)-pairs with first term 0.
%C A055168 Write 0 followed by segments defined inductively as follows:  each segment tells how many times each previously written integer occurs, stating first the integer being counted and then its frequency.  This is Method B (noun-before-adjective); for Method A (adjective-before-noun), see A217760. - _Clark Kimberling_ Mar 25 2013
%e A055168 Start with 0, then 0,1; then 2,0 and 1,1; etc. Writing pairs vertically,
%e A055168 the initial segments are
%e A055168 0..0..0 1..0 1 2..0 1 2 3..0 1 2 3 4 5..0 1 2 3 4 5 6..0 1.. 2 3 4 5 6 9
