%N A048249 Number of distinct values produced from sums and products of n unity arguments.
%C A048249 Values listed calculated by exhaustive search algorithm.
%C A048249 For n+1 operands (n operations) there are (2n)!/((n!)((n+1)!)) possible postfix forms over a single operator. For each such form, there are 2^n ways to assign 2 operators (here, sum and product). Calculate results and eliminate duplicates.

%F A048249 Equals partial sum of "number of numbers of complexity n" (A005421). - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Apr 07 2006
%e A048249 a(3)=3 since (in postfix): 111** = 11*1* = 1, 111*+ = 11*1+ = 111+* = 11+1* = 2 and 111++ = 11+1+ = 3. Note that at n=7, the 11 possible values produced are the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12}. This is the first n for which there are "skipped" values in the set.
