%N A051757 Consider problem of placing A051754(n) queens on an n X n board so that each queen attacks precisely 1 other. Sequence gives number of solutions up to square symmetry.
%C A051757 When n is a multiple of 3, the bound of 2[2n/3] queens is so tight that in solutions with that number of queens, all attacks must be along rows or columns, making solutions rare. - Jud McCranie
