%N A060167 Number of orbits of length n under the map whose periodic points are counted by A001642.
%C A060167 The sequence A001642 seems to record the number of points of period n under a map. The number of orbits of length n for this map gives the sequence above.

%F A060167 If a(n) is the n-th term of A001642, then the n-th term is u(n) = (1/n)* Sum_{ d divides n }\mu(d)a(n/d)
%e A060167 u(7) = 9 since a map whose periodic points are counted by A001642 would have 1 fixed point and 64 points of period 7, hence 9 orbits of length 7.
