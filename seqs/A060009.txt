%F A060009 Ulam numbers are positive integers that can be expressed in just one way as the sum of two distinct earlier members of the sequence in increasing order.
%e A060009 a(4)=11 is an Ulam number because 10 + 1 = 11, but 19 is not because there is more than one way to form 19 from summing previous sequence numbers, e.g. 18 + 1 and 10 + 9.
