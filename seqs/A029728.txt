%N A029728 Complete list of solutions to y^2=x^3+17; sequence gives x values.
%C A029728 Comments by Henri Cohen on the proof that the list of solutions is complete. (Start)
%C A029728 This is now completely standard. Cremona's mwrank program tells us that
%C A029728 this is an elliptic curve of rank 2 with generators P1=(-2,3) and P2=(4,9).
%C A029728 We now apply the algorithm (essentially due to Tzanakis and de Weger)
%C A029728 described in Nigel Smart's book on the algorithmic solution of Diophantine
%C A029728 equations: using Sinnou David's bounds on linear forms in elliptic
%C A029728 logarithms one finds that if P is an integral point then
%C A029728 P=aP1+bP2 for |a| and |b| less than a huge bound B (typically 10^100, sometimes
%C A029728 more, I didn't do the computation here), but the main point is that B
%C A029728 is completely explicit. One then uses the LLL algorithm: this is crucial.
%C A029728 A first application reduces the bound to 200, say, then a second application
%C A029728 to 20 and sometimes a third to 12 (at this point it is not necessary). Then
%C A029728 a very small search gives all the possible integer points. (End)
