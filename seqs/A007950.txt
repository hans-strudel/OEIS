%C A007950 Comments from C. Le (charlestle(AT)yahoo.com), Mar 22 2004: "A007950 and A007951 are particular cases of the Smarandache n-ary sequence sieve (for n=2 and respectively n=3).
%C A007950 "Definition of Smarandache n-ary sieve (n >= 2): Starting to count on the natural numbers set at any step from 1: - delete every n-th numbers; - delete, from the remaining numbers, every (n^2)-th numbers; ... and so on: delete, from the remaining ones, every (n^k)-th numbers, k = 1, 2, 3, ... .)
%C A007950 "Conjectures: there are infinitely many primes that belong to this sequence; also infinitely many composite numbers.
%C A007950 "Smarandache general-sequence sieve: Let u_i > 1, for i = 1, 2, 3, ..., be a strictly increasing positive integer sequence. Then from the natural numbers: - keep one number among 1, 2, 3, ..., u_1 - 1 and delete every u_1 -th numbers; - keep one number among the next u_2 - 1 remaining numbers and delete every u_2 -th numbers; ... and so on, for step k (k >= 1): - keep one number among the next u_k - 1 remaining numbers and delete every u_k -th numbers; ... "
%C A007950 Certainly this sequence contains infinitely many composite numbers, as it has finite density A048651, while the primes have zero density.
