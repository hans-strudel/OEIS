%N A056649 Number of non-unitary square divisors of central binomial coefficient.
%F A056649 a(n)=A056061(n)-2^r, where r is the number of prime factors in the largest unitary square(or square root) divisor of central binomial coefficient: r=A001221[A000188(A001405(n))/A055229(A001405(n))]
%e A056649 n=28, binomial[28,14]=2.2.2.3.3.3.5.5.17.19.23. Its has 384 divisors of which 8 are also square numbers: {1,4,9,25,36,100,225,900}and Only {4,9,36,100,225,900} are not unitary divisors. Thus a(28)=8-2=6. Observe large values (e.g. 223), where a(n)=0.
