%N A004136 Additive bases: a(n) is the least integer k such that in the cyclic group Z_k there is a subset of n elements all pairs (of not necessarily distinct elements) of which add up to a different sum (in Z_k).
%C A004136 a(n) >= n^2-n+1 by a volume bound. A difference set construction by Singer shows that equality holds when n-1 is a prime power. When n is a prime power, a difference set construction by Bose shows that a(n) <= n^2-1. By computation, equality holds in the latter bound at least for 7, 11 and 13.

%e A004136 a(3)=7: the set {0,1,3} is such a subset of Z_7, since 0+0, 0+1, 0+3, 1+1, 1+3 and 3+3 are all distinct in Z_7; also, no such 3-element set exists in any smaller cyclic group.
