%N A016098 Number of crossing set partitions of {1,2,...,n}.
%C A016098 A partition p of the set N_n = {1,2,...,n}, whose elements are arranged in their natural order, is crossing if there exist four numbers 1 <= i < k < j < l <= n such that i and j are in the same block, k and l are in the same block, but i,j and k,l belong to two different blocks. Noncrossing partitions are also called "planar rhyme schemes". - _Peter Luschny_, Apr 28 2011
%C A016098 Bell numbers (A000110) minus Catalan numbers (A000108). - Robert G. Wilson v
%C A016098 Consider a set of A000217(n) balls of n colors in which, for each integer k = 1 to n, exactly one color appears in the set a total of k times. (Each ball has exactly one color and is indistinguishable from other balls of the same color.) a(n+1) equals the number of ways to choose 0 or more balls of each color while satisfying the following conditions:
%C A016098 1. No two colors are chosen the same positive number of times.
%C A016098 2. Among colors chosen at least once, there exists at least one pair of colors (c, d) such that color c is chosen more times than color d, but color d appears more times in the original set than color c.
%C A016098 If the second requirement is removed, the number of acceptable ways to choose equals A000110(n+1). The number of ways that meet the first requirement, but fail to meet the second, equals A000108(n+1). See related comment for A085082. - _Matthew Vandermast_, Nov 22 2010
%D A016098 In the May 1978 Scientific American, Martin Gardner indicates that these are the "crossing" cases discussed by Jo Anne Growney (1970) - comment from _Alford Arnold_.
