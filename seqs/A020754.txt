%N A020754 Increasing gaps between squarefree numbers (lower end).
%F A020754 a(n) = A020755(n) - A020753(n); also a(n) = A020754(n+[n>10]) - 1 at least for n < 19. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 28 2015
%e A020754 The first gap in A005117 occurs between 1 and 2 and has length 1. The next largest gap occurs between 3 and 5 and has length 2. The next largest gap is between 7 and 10 and has length 3. Etc. We are only interested in gaps that set new records.
