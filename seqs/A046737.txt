%N A046737 Reduced period of A000073 mod n.
%C A046737 See A046738 for the period of the tribonacci numbers mod n. The ratio of the period to the reduced period is either 1 or 3. Robinson discusses the relationship between the period and the reduced period of a sequence. For the Fibonacci numbers, the analogous sequence is A001177. [From _T. D. Noe_, Jan 14 2009]

%e A046737 The tribonacci sequence (starting with 1) mod 7 has a period that repeats 1,1,2,4,0,6,3,2,4,2,1,0,3,4,0,0, 4,4,1,2,0,3,5,1,2,1,4,0,5,2,0,0,2,2,4,1,0,5,6,4,1,4,2,0,6,1,0,0. The first pair of zeros occurs at the 16th term. Hence a(7)=16. [From _T. D. Noe_, Jan 14 2009]
