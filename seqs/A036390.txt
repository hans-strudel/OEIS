%N A036390 First differences of composite connected numbers (A029827).
%C A036390 Observe the high local gaps, which arise between two connected numbers of binary order (A029837) g and g+1. E.g. five consecutive connected numbers in A029827 are 4087,4089,4095,4369,4471 and corresponding differences are 2,6,274 and 102. Thus the density of connected numbers rises and falls in interval [ 2^(g-1),2^g ].
%Y A036390 Cf. A029827, A029837.
%K A036390 nonn
%O A036390 1,1
