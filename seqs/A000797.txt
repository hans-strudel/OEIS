%N A000797 Numbers that are not the sum of 4 tetrahedral numbers.
%C A000797 It is an open problem of long standing ("Pollock's Conjecture") to show that this sequence is finite.
%C A000797 More precisely, Salzer and Levine conjecture that every number is the sum of at most 5 tetrahedral numbers and in fact that there are exactly 241 numbers (the terms of this sequence) that require 5 tetrahedral numbers, the largest of which is 343867.
