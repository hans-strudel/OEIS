%N A001548 Number of connected linear spaces with n (unlabeled) points.
%C A001548 Euler transform is A001200. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 24 2014
%C A001548 In any linear space any two distinct points belong to exactly one line. A linear space is disconnected if there exists a partition of the points of the space into two subsets such that for any two distinct points in a subset of the partition the unique line they both belong to is completely contained in that subset. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 24 2014

%e A001548 a(2) = 0 because the unique linear space on two points can be partitioned into two single point subsets which disconnects the space vacuously. a(5) = 2 because there are two connected linear spaces with 5 points: one has only one line and the other has two lines with three points that intersect in one point that belongs to no other line while the other four points belong to three lines. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 24 2014
