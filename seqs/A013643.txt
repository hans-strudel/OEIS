%N A013643 Numbers n such that continued fraction for sqrt(n) has period 3.
%C A013643 All numbers of the form (5n+1)^2 + 4n + 1 for n>0 are elements of this sequence. Numbers of the above form have the continued fraction expansion [5n+1,[2,2,10n+2]]. General square roots of integers with period 3 continued fraction expansions have expansions of the form [n,[2m,2m,2n]]. - _David Terr_, Jun 15 2004

%F A013643 The general form of these numbers is d = d(m, n) = a^2 + 4mn + 1, where m and n are positive integers and a = a(m, n) = (4m^2 + 1)n + m, for which the continued fraction expansion of sqrt(d) is [a;[2m, 2m, 2a]]. - _David Terr_, Jul 20 2004
