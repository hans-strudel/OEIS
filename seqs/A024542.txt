%e A024542 a(6)=2. Without cut, after shuffle 1 (s1), order is 4 1 5 2 6 3; after s2, 2 4 6 1 3 5; after s3, 1 2 3 4 5 6. Mean distances between cards after s1 = 3.4 (17/5), s2 = 2.6 (13/5), s3 = 1 (5/5). 35/15=2.3, cumulative mean distance, so lower bound is 2. (Cuts change number of shuffles required to return cards to original order, in this case from 3 to 4.)
