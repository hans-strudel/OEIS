%N A057973 Number of polybricks: number of ways to arrange n 1 X 2 "bricks" in a wall (see illustrations).
%C A057973 The tiling of bricks is topologically the same as that by regular hexagons and this sequence can also be seen as counting polyhexes where two polyhexes are equivalent iff they are related by a symmetry that is also a symmetry of the tiling by bricks.
