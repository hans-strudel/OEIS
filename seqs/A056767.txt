%N A056767 Largest number of binary size n (i.e. between (n-1)-th and n-th powers of 2) with the following property: cube of its number of divisors is larger than the number itself.
%F A056767 Largest terms of A056757 between 2^(n-1) and 2^n.
%e A056767 These maximal terms are usually "near" to 2^n, for n=1-10 are equal to 2^n. At n=21, a(21)=2097144, 1048576<a(21)<2097144=8*27*7*19*73 has 128 divisors, of which the cube is ddd=2097152. So this maximum is near but still below d^3.
