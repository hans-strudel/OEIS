%N A055100 In the game of backgammon, the number of blot hitting rolls when the blot is n points away, n=1,2,...,24.
%C A055100 A finite sequence, since a(25) does not exist (a blot cannot be 25 pips away, neither can 25 pips be rolled with two dice). In backgammon, if a double is rolled then the number is played four times, not twice. Hence a roll of 22 hits a blot 8 pips away.
%e A055100 a(1)=11 since only these rolls hit: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61. a(8)=6 since only these rolls hit: 22, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62. a(13)=0 since no roll hits.
