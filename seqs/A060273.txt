%N A060273 Hard numbers: a(n) = smallest number m with f(m) = n, where f(m) is the smallest number of digits that are needed to construct m using only 1's, 2's and any number of +, -, *, ^ signs, allowing concatenation of the digits.
%C A060273 It seems that to obtain this sequence we need to impose two additional rules: 1. x-y is allowed only when x-y > 0 (which also applies to A060274). 2. "Allowing concatenation of the digits" *only* applies to the base digits, 1 and 2, not to the decimal representations of subexpression values. So for example, 13 cannot be obtained via: 13 = 1 concat 3 = 1 concat (1+2) because "3" is not a string consisting solely of 1's or 2's, but can be obtained via: 13 = 11 + 2 = (1 concat 1) + 2. Then the example 151 really does have complexity 7 under this measure.

%e A060273 a(7) = 151 because 151 is the smallest number that requires 7 digits for its expression.
