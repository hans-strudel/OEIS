%N A056951 Triangle whose rows show the result of flipping the first, first two, ... and finally first n coins when starting with the stack (1,2,3,4,...,n) [starting with all heads up, where signs show whether particular coins end up heads or tails.].
%F A056951 T(n, k) = 2k-n-b with 1<=k<=n (where b=2 if 2k<=n+1, b=1 otherwise)
%e A056951 Third row is constructed by starting from (1,2,3), going to (-1,2,3), then going to (-2,1,3) and finally going to (-3,-1,2). Rows are: (-1), (-2,1), (-3,-1,2), (-4,-2,1,3) etc. as each row is reverse of previous row, with signs changed and -n added as the first term in the row.
%t A056951 t[n_, 1] := -n; t[n_, n_] := n-1; t[n_, k_] := 2*k-n - If[2*k <= n+1, 2, 1]; Table[t[n, k], {n, 1, 14}, {k, 1, n}] // Flatten (* _Jean-FranÃ§ois Alcover_, Oct 03 2013 *)
%Y A056951 A003558 is the number of times the operation needs to be repeated to return to the starting point, taking no account of heads/tails (i.e. signs). A002326 is the number required if heads/tails (i.e. signs) are also required to return to their original position.
%Y A056951 Cf. A130517 (unsigned version).
