%N A054039 a(n)^2 is the least square to contain n different decimal digits.
%C A054039 It turns out that "...at least n..." and "...exactly n..." yield the same (and thus strictly increasing) sequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 02 2009
%e A054039 13^2=169 is the first square to contain exactly 3 different digits; 322^2=103684 is the first square to contain exactly 6 different digits.
%o A054039 (PARI) A054039(n,k=0) = { while( #Set(Vec(Str(k^2)))<n, k++); k } /* If "exactly n" would correspond to a different sequence, this would yield some term twice in a row. The optional 2nd arg can be used to find further terms with a given # of distinct digits. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 02 2009 */
