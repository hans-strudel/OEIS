%F A047982 a(n) = min {d}: A034693(a(n)) is an odd number k such that in a(n)*k+1 progression the first prime occurs at k=2n+1 position.
%e A047982 a(2)=38 because A034693(38) = 2*2+1 =5 is the first 5; 5*38+1=191 is the first prime. The successive progressions in which the first prime appears at position 5 are as follows: 38k+1,62k+1,164k+1. 2nd example: a(20)=102296 because. The first 41 appears in A034693 at this index. Also 102296*(2*20+1)+1=102296*41+1=4194137 is the first prime in {102296k+1}. The next progression with this position of prime emergence is 109946k+1 (the corresponding prime is 4507787).
