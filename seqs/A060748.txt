%N A060748 Smallest m such that x^3+y^3=m has rank n, if m exists.
%C A060748 Nick Rogers (rogers(AT)fas.harvard.edu), Jul 03 2003: I have verified that the first 5 entries are correct; the first two are basically trivial and the third is due to Selmer. I'm not sure who first discovered entries 4 and 5 and I expect that they had been previously proved to be the smallest values, (cont.)
%C A060748 but I have rechecked that they are minimal for their respective rank using a combination of 3-descent, MAGMA and John Cremona's program mwrank. (cont.)
%C A060748 There are new smaller values for ranks 6 and 7, namely k = 9902523 has rank 6 and k = 1144421889 has rank 7. 3-descent combined with Ian Connell's package apecs for Maple verifies that these are minimal subject to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for L-functions associated to elliptic curves. (cont.)
%C A060748 Finally, there are new entries for ranks 8 and 9: k = 1683200989470 has rank 8 and k = 148975046052222390 has rank 9. It seems somewhat likely that the rank 8 example is minimal. (end.)
%C A060748 The sequence might be finite, even if it is redefined as smallest m such that x^3+y^3=m has rank >= n. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Oct 27 2013
