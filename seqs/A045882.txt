%N A045882 Smallest term of first run of (at least) n consecutive integers which are not squarefree.
%C A045882 Solution for n=10 is same as for n=11.
%C A045882 This sequence is infinite and each term initiates a suitable arithmetic progression with large differences like squares of primorials or other suitable products of primes from prime factors being on power 2 in terms and in chains after. Proof includes solution of linear Diophantine equations and math. induction.
