%N A049300 Smallest number which begins the maximal number of consecutive integers divisible by one of the first n prime numbers.
%C A049300 The length of such maximal chain of consecutive integers is given by A058989(n), which is the first maximal gaps A048670(n) minus 1 in the reduced residue system of consecutive primorial numbers.
%C A049300 Let j(m) be the Jacobsthal function (A048669): maximal distance between integers relatively prime to m. Let m=2*3*5*...*prime(n). Then a(n) is the least k>0 such that k,k+1,k+2,...k+j(m)-2 are not coprime to m. Note that a(n) begins (or is inside) a large gap between primes. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 29 2007
%H A049300 Max Alekseyev, <a href="/A049300/b049300.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..24</a>
%F A049300 One of prime(1), ..., prime(n) divides a maximal number of consecutive integers starting with a(n), which is minimal with such property.
%F A049300 a(n) = 1 + A128707(A002110(n)). - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 29 2007
%e A049300 Between 1 and 7, all 5 numbers (2,3,4,5,6) are divisible either by 2,3 or 5. Thus a(3)=2, the initial term. Between 113 and 127 the 13 consecutive integers are divisible by 2,5,2,3,2,7,2,11,2,3,2,5,2, each from {2,3,5,7,11}. Thus a(5)=114, the smallest with this property.
