%N A060112 Sums of nonconsecutive factorial numbers.
%C A060112 Zeckendorf (Fibonacci) expansion of n (A003714) reinterpreted as a factorial expansion.
%C A060112 Also positions in A055089, A060117 and A060118 of the permutations that are composed of disjoint adjacent transpositions only. (That these positions are same can be seen by comparing algorithms PermRevLexUnrankAMSD, PermUnrank3R, PermUnrank3L in the respective sequences). Thus also positions of the fixed terms in A065181 - A065184. See comment at A065163.
%C A060112 Written as disjoint cycles the permutations are: (), (1 2), (2 3), (3 4), (1 2)(3 4), (4 5), (1 2)(4 5), (2 3)(4 5), etc. Apart from the first one (the identity), these are the only kind of permutations used in campanology when moving from one "change" to next.

%Y A060112 Subset of A059590. Cf. also A064640.
