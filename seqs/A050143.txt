%N A050143 Array T by antidiagonals: T(i,j)=Sum{T(h,k): 0<=h<=i-1, 0<=k<=j}, T(i,0)=1 for i >= 0, T(0,j)=0 for j >= 1.
%C A050143 Formatted as a triangular array with offset (0,8), it is [0, 1, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...] DELTA [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...] where DELTA is the operator defined in A084938 . - _Philippe DelÃ©ham_, Nov 05 2006
%C A050143 The sum of the first two columns gives the powers of 2, that is, Sum[T(i,j),j=0..1] = 2^i, i>=0. On the other hand, for i>=1 and j>=2, T(i,j) is the number of lattice paths of i-1 upsteps (1,1) and j-1 downsteps (1,-1) in which each downstep-free vertex is colored red or blue. A downstep-free vertex is one not incident with a downstep. For example, dots indicate the downstep-free vertices in the path .U.U.UDU.UDDU., and with i=j=2, T(2,2) = 4 counts UD, *UD, DU, DU*, where asterisks indicate the red vertices. - David Callan, Aug 27 2011
%e A050143 Antidiagonals, each starting on top row: {1}; {0,1}; {0,1,1}; {0,1,3,1}; ...
%Y A050143 Antidiagonal sums are odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers (A001519).
%Y A050143 Signed alternating antidiagonal sums are F(n)-2, as in A001911.
