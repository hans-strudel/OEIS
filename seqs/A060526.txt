%N A060526 A list of equal temperaments (equal divisions of the octave) whose nearest scale steps are closer and closer approximations to the ratios of six simple musical tones: 8/7 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 7/4.
%C A060526 The sequence was found by a computer search of all of the equal divisions of the octave from 1 to over 84814.
%C A060526 The numerical value of each term represents a musical scale based on an equal division of the octave. 12, for example, signifies the scale which is formed by dividing the octave into 12 equal parts.
%F A060526 Recurrence: the next term equals the current term plus one or more of the previous terms: a(n+1) = a(n) + a(n-x)... + a(n-y)... +a(n-z)..., etc.
%e A060526 84 = 53 + the previous term 31. Again, 291152 = 103169 + the previous terms (84814 + 81689 + 11664 + 9816).
%Y A060526 Cf. A054540, A060525, A060257.
