%N A005163 Number of alternating sign n X n matrices that are symmetric about a diagonal.
%C A005163 Robbins's paper does not give a formula for this sequence. On the contrary he states: "Apparently these numbers do not factor into small primes, so a simple product formula seems unlikely. Of course this does not rule out other very simple formulas, but these would be more difficult to discover (let alone prove)." As far as I know no formula is currently known. - Herman Jamke (hermanjamke(AT)fastmail.fm), Feb 23 2008
