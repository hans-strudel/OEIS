%N A057887 Number of 4-tuples of integers with GCD=1 and giving the lengths of sides of a nondegenerate quadrilateral with perimeter n.
%F A057887 Moebius transform of A057886.
%e A057887 There are five quadrilaterals with perimeter 8, with sides (1,1,3,3), (1,2,2,3), (1,2,3,2), (1,3,1,3) and (2,2,2,2). (2,2,2,2) is omitted since it has GCD=2, so a(8)=4.
