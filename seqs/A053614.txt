%N A053614 Numbers that are not the sum of distinct triangular numbers.
%C A053614 The Mathematica program first computes A024940, the number of partitions of n into distinct triangular numbers. Then it finds those n having zero such partitions. It appears that A024940 grows exponentially, which would preclude additional terms in this sequence. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 24 2006, Jan 05 2009
%D A053614 Joe Roberts, Lure of the Integers, page 184, entry 33.
%D A053614 David Wells in "The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers, Revised Edition, page 94, states that "33 is the largest number that is not the sum of distinct triangular numbers".
%F A053614 Complement of A061208.
%e A053614 a(2) = 5: the 7 partitions of 5 are 5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1. Among those the distinct ones are 5, 4+1, 3+2. None contains all distinct triangular numbers.
%e A053614 12 is a term as it is not a sum of 1, 3, 6 or 10 taken at most once.
%t A053614 nn=100; t=Rest[CoefficientList[Series[Product[(1+x^(k*(k+1)/2)), {k,nn}], {x,0,nn(nn+1)/2}], x]]; Flatten[Position[t,0]] - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 24 2006
