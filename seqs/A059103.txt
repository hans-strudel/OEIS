%N A059103 Number of simple, connected, unit-distance graphs on n points realizable in the plane with straight edges all of the same length; lines are permitted to cross.
%C A059103 This counting problem is related to the well-known problem of finding the "chromatic number of the plane, X(R^2)."
%C A059103 The existence of a simple, connected, unit-distance graph that is n-colorable, 5<=n<=7, will raise the lower bound on X(R^2) from 4, the current lower bound, to n. The upper bound is 7, so should a 7-colorable, simple, connected, unit-distance graph be found, the chromatic number of the plane problem will be solved. - _Matthew McAndrews_, Feb 21 2016

%e A059103 a(4)=5 because the complete graph on 4 points cannot be realized in the plane with all edges of equal length. All the other connected graphs with 4 points can be realized.

%A A059103 _David S. Newman_, Feb 13 2001
%E A059103 a(6) has been updated to reflect the fact that it has recently been proved to be 51 rather than 50. - _Matthew McAndrews_, Feb 21 2016
