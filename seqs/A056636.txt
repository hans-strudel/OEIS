%N A056636 Conjecturally largest even integer which is the sum of two primes in at most n ways.
%C A056636 The Goldbach conjecture is that every even number >= 4 is the sum of two primes.
%H A056636 <a href="/index/Go#Goldbach">Index entries for sequences related to Goldbach conjecture</a>
%F A056636 a(n) = max({A000954(i),i=0..n}). - _Robert Israel_, Mar 21 2016
%e A056636 a(1) is 12 because it is the largest even integer having only 1 distinct way to express it as the sum of two primes (7+5) and a(0) < 12.
%e A056636 a(8) = 398 because it is the largest number in A000954 for n <= 8.
%Y A056636 Cf. A045917, A023036, A000954.
%K A056636 nonn
%O A056636 0,1
