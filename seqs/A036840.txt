%N A036840 a(n) = average of the repeating terms of {T(n,k)} rounded to the nearest integer (rounding up if there's a choice), if {T(n,k)} is eventually periodic; = 0 otherwise. Here T(n,k) is the "phi/sigma tug-of-war sequence with seed n" defined by T(n,1) = phi(n), T(n,2) = sigma(phi(n)), T(n,3) = phi(sigma(phi(n))), ..., T(n,k) = phi(T(n,k-1)) if k is odd and = sigma(T(n,k-1)) if k is even.
%C A036840 Conjecture: a(n) is never 0; i.e. the sequence {T(n,k)} is eventually periodic for every n.
%C A036840 a(n) - n can be thought of as the final score in the phi/sigma tug-of-war with seed n. For example a(5) - 5 = 7 - 5 = 2, so sigma wins by "2 points" over phi at 5. a(8) - 8 = 7 - 8 = -1, so phi wins by "1 point" over sigma at 8. a(3) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0, so it is a tie at 3. Are sigma's margins of victory over phi bounded? Are phi's bounded?
%e A036840 The sequence {T(5,k)} is 4, 7, 6, 12, 4, 7, .... The average of the repeating numbers is 7.25 which rounds off to 7. So a(5) = 7. The sequence {T(37,k)} is 36, 91, 72, 195, 96, 252, 72, 195, .... The average of the repeating numbers is 153.75, which rounds off to 154. So a(37) = 154.
