%N A014778 Numbers n equal to the number of 1's in the decimal digits of all numbers <= n.
%C A014778 The full list of 84 terms is given in the b-file.
%C A014778 It can be proved that this sequence is finite. (The main idea of the proof is that the number of 1's used in positive integers <= n is greater than or equal to A(n) = (1/10) number of digits in positive integers from 1 to n = (1/10) Sum_{i=1,...n} (1+floor(log_10 i)). By considering the area below a logarithmic function and the corresponding integral, it can be shown that A(n)/n goes to infinity.) - _Joseph L. Pe_, Nov 05 2002
