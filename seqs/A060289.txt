%S A060289 4,5,17,53,250,1404,9013
%N A060289 Number of distinct (non-overlapping) twin Harshad numbers whose sum is prime and where the 2nd Harshad is <= 10^n.
%C A060289 This sequence seems to be incorrect. _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 03 2014
%F A060289 Generate the twin Harshads whose sum is prime. Count how many there are where the 2nd Harshad in the pair is <= a consecutive power of 10.
%e A060289 a(1)=4 because there are four pairs of Harshads whose sum is prime and the 2nd Harshad in the pair is <=10; these are 1+2=3, 3+4=7, 5+6=11, 9+10=19. 8+9=17 is not included because this pair overlaps 7+8=15, which also happens to be not prime. (Another sequence might include such overlapping pairs.)
