%N A052160 Isolated prime difference equals 6: d(n)=p(n+1)-p(n)=6 but d(n+1) and d(n-1) different from 6.
%C A052160 Compare to A047948 and A033451 which initial primes of X66Y and X666Y consecutive prime difference patterns, terms of A001223. No other "islands of 6" occur in A001223: X6Y,X66Y or X666Y.
%e A052160 Consecutive primes 17,19,23,29,31 gives 2,4,6,2,.. difference patterne in which the neighboring differences of 6 are not equal to 6. Remark that terms a(n)-6 can be prime but not immediate precedent one, like 23-6=17, but prior to 19 comes before 23.
