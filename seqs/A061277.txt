%N A061277 Numbers which have more different digits than their squares.
%C A061277 The sequence is infinite since for every element k with '0' as last digit or no '0' at all every k*10^m is also in it.
%e A061277 3114 is okay, since it has three different digits while 3114^2 = 9696996 has only two.
%o A061277 (PARI) isok(n) = length(Set(digits(n, 10))) > length(Set(digits(n^2, 10))) \\ _Michel Marcus_, Jul 22 2013
