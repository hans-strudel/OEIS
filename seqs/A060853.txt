%N A060853 Number of possible games of 10-pin bowling with a total score of n.
%C A060853 For small n, this is equal to the binomial coefficient C(n,19). We have eleven possibilities for the first ball thrown in the first frame (gutter, 1, 2, ..., 9, strike) and the same possibilities occur for each of the other nine frames. So without even considering the second ball in each frame, at a minimum we have 11^10 possibilities. In fact, the true number of games is much larger due to the effect of the second ball in each frame. It's easy to show that the total number of possible games is: 66^9 * 241 = 5726805883325784576. The number of possible games with scores n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, are: 1, 20, 210, 1540, 8855, 42504... The maximal number of possible games is for the score n = 77, namely 172542309343731946. Then there are a declining number of ways to get very high scores. For n = 288, 289, ..., 300 the totals are: 12, 11, 11, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. The distribution of number of possible games as a function of n is not precisely symmetric about its maximal point. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jul 15 2005
