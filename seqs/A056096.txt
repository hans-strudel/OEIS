%N A056096 Maximum value in the distribution by first value of Prufer code of noncrossing spanning trees on a circle of n+2 points; perhaps the number whose Prufer code starts with 2.
%C A056096 Total in distribution is # t_n of ternary trees and one can prove first and last values in each distribution is t_{n-1}. Maximum appears to occur at 2, minimum near end; perhaps monotone between first, max, min, last. Distributions of Prufer code initial values, starting with 3 points: [1,1,1], [3,4,2,3], [12,17,9,5,12], [55,80,44,22,17,55], [273,403,227,112,68,72,273],[1428,2128,1218,603,335,267,345,1428].
%C A056096 First 200 values (n=3 to 202) of max occur at k=2; first 200 values of min (series A056098) occur at k=floor((n+5)/2).
%F A056096 G.f.: seems to be (g+1)/(1-g)^3 where g*(1-g)^2 = x. - Mark van Hoeij, Nov 10 2011
%e A056096 There are 12 noncrossing spanning trees on a circle of 4 points. The first values of their Prufer codes have distribution [3,4,2,3], e.g. 3 start with 1, 4 with 2 and so on. The maximum is a(4) = 4.
%Y A056096 Cf. A056098.
%K A056096 nonn
%O A056096 3,2
