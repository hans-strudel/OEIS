%N A053804 Numbers where the difference of consecutive fifth powers is "close" to another fifth power: let A = x^5 - (x-1)^5, sequence is the x's where A - int(A^(1/5))^5 < int(x^(1/2))^5.
%e A053804 a(2)=3509 because A = 3509^5-3508^5 = 757627875663781 and the condition 'A - int(A^(1/5))^5 < int(x^(1/2))^5' simplifies to '757627875663781 - 946^5 < 59^5' which is true.
