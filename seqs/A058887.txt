%N A058887 Smallest prime p such that (2^n)*p is a nontotient number.
%C A058887 For n=8,9,...,582, a(n) = 47. Note that A040076(47)=583.
%C A058887 For n=583,584,...,6392, a(n) = 383. Note that A040076(383)=6393.
%C A058887 Subsequent primes are 2897, 3061, 5297, and 7013 (cf. A057192 and A071628).
%C A058887 Starting with some large N, a(n)=p for all n >= N. This prime p will likely be the first prime Sierpi≈Ñski number, which is conjectured to be 271129.
%C A058887 In particular, a(n) <= 271129 for all n.

%F A058887 Min{p|p is prime and nops(invphi((2^n)*p))=0}
%e A058887 For n=1, the initial segment of {2p} sequence is nops(invphi({2p}))={4, 4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, ...}, where the position of the first 0 is 4, corresponding to p(4)=7, so a(1)=7.
%e A058887 For n=8 the same initial segment is: {11, 32, 23, 18, 24, 10, 11, 4, 9, 21, 2, 16, 9, 12, 0, 14, 5, 6, 12, ...}, where the first 0 is the 15th, corresponding to p(15)=47, thus a(8)=47.
