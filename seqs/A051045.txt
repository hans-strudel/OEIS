%I A051045
%S A051045 1,2,8,44,298,2350,22774
%N A051045 Number of distinct resistances possible for n resistors with resistances 1, 2, ..., n, each connected in series or parallel to the previous one.
%C A051045 For n = 4, there would be an additional 4 possible values if circuits were allowed that combine complex subcircuits in series or parallel, rather than requiring that one of them consists of a single resistor. See illustration in links. - _Kival Ngaokrajang_, Aug 22 2013 (rephrased by _Dave R.M. Langers_, Nov 13 2013)
