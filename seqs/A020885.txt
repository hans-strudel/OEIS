%N A020885 Ordered areas (divided by 6) of primitive Pythagorean triangles (with multiple entries).
%C A020885 Since squares are 0 or 1 under both mod 3 and mod 4, for the Pythagorean equation A^2 + B^2 = C^2 to hold, each of 3 and 4 divides either of leg A or leg B, so that area A*B/2 is divisible by 3*4/2 = 6. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Apr 30 2004
%C A020885 From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 14 2015: (Start)
%C A020885 This sequence gives the area/6 (in some squared length unit) of primitive Pythagorean triangles with multiplicities modulo leg exchange. See the example.
%C A020885 This sequence also gives Fibonacci's congruous numbers divided by 24, with multiplicities and ordered nondecreasingly. See A258150.

%F A020885 a(n) = A024406(n)/6.
%e A020885 a(6) = a(7) = 35 from the two Pythagorean triangles (A,B,C) = (21, 20, 29)  and (35, 12, 37) with area 210. Triangles (20, 21, 29) and (12, 35, 37) are not counted (leg exchange). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 14 2015
