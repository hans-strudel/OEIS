%N A053837 Sum of digits of n modulo 10.
%F A053837 a(n) =A010879(A007953(n)) =(n+a(floor[n/10])) mod 10. So can construct sequence by starting with 0 and mapping 0->0123456789, 1->1234567890, 2->2345678901 etc. (e.g. 0, 0123456789, 0123456789123456789023456789013456789012456..., etc.) and looking at n-th digit of a term with sufficient digits.
%e A053837 a(59)=4 because 5+9 = 14 = 4 mod 10
%Y A053837 Cf. A000120, A007953, A010060, A053838-A053844.
