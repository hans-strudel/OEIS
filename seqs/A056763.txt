%N A056763 Number of x integers between 2^(n-1) and 2^n for which d(x)^3 > x holds, i.e. cube of number of divisors of x exceeds the number x and binary size of x is n.
%e A056763 a(5)=11 because 11 integers occur between 1+2^4=17 and 2^ 5=32 for which the cube of number of divisors exceeds the number itself: {18,20,21,22,24,25,26,27,28,30,32} Between 2^28 and 2^29 1730 such numbers occur.
