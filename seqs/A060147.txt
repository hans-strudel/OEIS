%N A060147 Nim-binomial transform of the Nim-squares sequence {0,1,3,2,6,7,5,4,13,12,14,...}.
%C A060147 The Nim-binomial transform of the Nim-squares consists of the Nim-squares of the terms of the Nim-binomial transform of the integers (given in A048298).
%C A060147 Multiplicative with a(2^e) = A006017(e), a(p^e) = 0 otherwise. - _David W. Wilson_, Jun 12 2005
