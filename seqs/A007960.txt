%N A007960 Numbers n with property that some permutation of the digits of n is a triangular number.
%C A007960 Leading zeros may be omitted from the permutation of the digits of n to get T. But the number of digits of T must be <= the number of digits of n. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 14 2007
%C A007960 Working modulo 9, A010878(A000217(j)) is in the set {0, 1, 3, 6} for all j, never in {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}. Since permutation of decimal digits does not change values mod 9, A010878(n) is also one of {0,1,3,6}. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 08 2008
