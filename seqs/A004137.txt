%N A004137 Maximal number of edges in a graceful graph on n nodes.
%C A004137 A graph with e edges is 'graceful' if its nodes can be labeled with distinct integers in {0,1,...,e} so that, if each edge is labeled with the absolute difference between the labels of its endpoints, then the e edges have the distinct labels 1, 2, ..., e.
%C A004137 Equivalently, maximum m for which there's a restricted difference basis with respect to m with n elements. A 'difference basis w.r.t. m' is a set of integers such that every integer from 1 to m is a difference between two elements of the set. A 'restricted' difference basis is one in which the smallest element is 0 and the largest is m.
%C A004137 a(n) is also the length of an optimal ruler with n marks. For definitions see A103294. For example a(6)=13 is the length of the optimal rulers with 6 marks, {[0, 1, 6, 9, 11, 13], [0, 2, 4, 7, 12, 13], [0, 1, 4, 5, 11, 13], [0, 2, 8, 9, 12, 13], [0, 1, 2, 6, 10, 13], [0, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13]}. Also n = 1 + A103298(a(n)). - _Peter Luschny_, Feb 28 2005
%C A004137 If the conjecture is true that an optimal ruler with more than 12 segments is a Wichmann ruler than the sequence continues 232, 251, 270, 289, 308, 327, ... - _Peter Luschny_, Oct 09 2011 [updated to take the verifications of Robison into account, Oct 01 2015]

%e A004137 a(7)=17: Label the 7 nodes 0,1,8,11,13,15,17 and include all edges except those from 8 to 15, from 13 to 15, from 13 to 17 and from 15 to 17. {0,1,8,11,13,15,17} is a restricted difference basis w.r.t. 17.
%e A004137 a(21)=153 because there exists a complete ruler (i.e., one that can measure every distance between 1 and 153) with marks [0,1,2,3,7,14,21,28,43,58,73,88,103,118,126,134,142,150,151,152,153] and no complete ruler of greater length with the same number of marks can be found. This ruler is of the type described by B. Wichmann and is conjectured by P. Luschny that it is impossible to beat Wichmann's construction for finding optimal rulers of bigger lengths.
