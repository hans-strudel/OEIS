%N A002962 Number of simple imperfect squared squares of order n up to symmetry.
%C A002962 A squared rectangle (which may be a square) is a rectangle dissected into a finite number, two or more, of squares. If no two of these squares have the same size the squared rectangle is perfect. A squared rectangle is simple if it does not contain a smaller squared rectangle. The order of a squared rectangle is the number of constituent squares. - _Geoffrey H. Morley_, Oct 17 2012]
%C A002962 Orders 15 to 19 were enumerated by C. J. Bowkamp and A. J. W. Duijvestijn (1962). Orders 20 to 29 were enumerated by Stuart Anderson (2010-2012). Orders 30 to 32 were enumerated by Lorenz Milla and Stuart Anderson (2013). - _Stuart E Anderson_, Sep 30 2013
