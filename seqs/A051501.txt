%N A051501 Bertrand primes III: a(n+1) is the smallest prime > 2^a(n).
%C A051501 The terms in the sequence are floor(2^b), floor(2^2^b), floor(2^2^2^b), ..., where b is approximately 1.2516475977905.
%C A051501 The existence of b is a consequence of Bertrand's postulate.
%C A051501 a(5) is much larger than the largest known prime, which is currently only 2^32582657-1. - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 18 2007
%C A051501 This sequence is of course not computed from b; rather b is more precisely computed by determining the next term in the sequence.
