%N A020942 First column of 3rd-order Zeckendorf array.
%C A020942 I would like to get similar sequences where the least term in the representation is 2 [ gives 2 8 11 15 21 27 30... ], 3, 4, 6, etc. They are the 2nd, 3rd, etc. columns of the 3rd-order Zeckendorf array.

%F A020942 Any number n has unique representation as a sum of terms from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19, ...} (cf. A000930) such that no two terms are adjacent or pen-adjacent; e.g., 7=6+1. Sequence gives all n where that representation involves 1.
%e A020942 1=1; 5=4+1; 7=6+1; 10=9+1; etc.
