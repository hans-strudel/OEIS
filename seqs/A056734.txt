%N A056734 Numbers n such that 2^n in base 3 has same number of 0's as 2^(n+1) in base 3 and 2^n and 2^(n+1) have the same number of digits in base 3.
%C A056734 Using empirical data for 1 <= n <= 10000, it has been found that the distribution of these terms correlates well (R^2 = 0.9513) to f(n) = a*n^(1/2) with 'a' a constant approximately 0.73. In addition, f'(n) approximates the probability that any particular n has this property. Any terms in A056154 must also satisfy this sequence.
%e A056734 First term: 2^2 = 11, 2^3 = 22, both with 0 zeros and both of length 2. Second term: 2^5 = 1012, 2^6 = 2101, both with 1 zero and both of length 4.
