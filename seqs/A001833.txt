%N A001833 Number of labeled graded partially ordered sets with n elements.
%C A001833 Here "graded" means that there exists a rank function rk from the poset to the integers such that whenever v covers w in the poset, we have rk(v) = rk(w) + 1. Note that this notion of grading is weaker than in sequence A006860, which counts posets in which all maximal chains have the same length.

%e A001833 The poset on {a, b, c, d, e} defined by the relations a < b < c and d < e is counted by this sequence. (For example, one associated rank function is rk(a) = rk(d) = 0, rk(b) = rk(e) = 1 and rk(c) = 2.) However, the poset defined by the relations a < b < c and a < d < e < c is not graded and so not counted by this sequence.
%Y A001833 Graded posets with no chain of length 3 are counted by A001831.
