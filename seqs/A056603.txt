%N A056603 Squarefree kernels of distinct values of LCM[1,..,m] (A051451).
%e A056603 Only values of A002110 arise with repetitions, but the sequence is not identical to A034386. It is more compact than A034386, but still not a repetition-free primorial sequence. E.g. 1,2,6,30,210,2310,30030,..times occurs in A034386 1,1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,..while the same values arise here 1,1,2,1,3,1,2,1,1,.. times. This sequence represents a transition between A034386 and the more compact A002110.
%Y A056603 A002110, A034386, A003418, A051451.
