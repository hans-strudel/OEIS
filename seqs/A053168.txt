%N A053168 Hamming weights (or nonlinearity) of degree 4 rotation-symmetric functions.
%C A053168 T. W. Cusick and P. Stanica conjectured that the Hamming weight and the nonlinearity are the same for rotation-symmetric functions of degree 3. We conjecture that the same is true for rotation-symmetric functions of any degree.

%e A053168 a(4)=1, since the weight (or nonlinearity) of x1*x2*x3*x4 is 1.
%e A053168 a(5)=6, since the weight (or nonlinearity) of x1*x2*x3*x4+x2*x3*x4*x5+x3*x4*x5*x1+x4*x5*x1*x2+x5*x1*x2*x3 is 6.
