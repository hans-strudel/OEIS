%C A016104 w is uniquely defined as the largest value such that for all n>0, a(n) is prime. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 25 2006
%C A016104 Hardy's paper uses this as an example, although the sequence is not well-defined there. The next term is probably 2^16382-35411, a 4932-digit prp. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 25 2006
