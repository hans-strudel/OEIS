%N A056910 Numbers n where 36n^2+12n+7 is prime (sorted by absolute values with negatives before positives).
%C A056910 36m^2+12m+7=(6m+1)^2+6 which is six more than a square.
%F A056910 a(n) =(-1+/-sqrt(A056909(n)-6))/6, choosing +/- to give an integer result for each n
%e A056910 a(2)=-2 since 36*(-2)^2+12*(-2)+7=127 which is prime (as well as being six more than a square)
%Y A056910 This sequence and formula generate all primes of the form k^2+6, i.e. A056909. Except for the first term, none of the a(n) are a multiple of 7 and so the rest of this sequence is a subsequence of A047304. Cf. A056900, A056902, A056904, A056906, A056907, A056908.
