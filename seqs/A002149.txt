%N A002149 Largest prime p==3 (mod 8) such that Q(sqrt(-p)) has class number 2n+1.
%C A002149 Most of these values are only conjectured to be correct.
%C A002149 Apr 15 2008: David Broadhurst says: I computed class numbers for prime discriminants with |D| < 10^9, but stopped when the first case with |D| > 5*10^8 was observed. That factor of 2 seems to me to be a reasonable margin of error, when you look at the pattern of what is included.
