%N A054026 a(n) is the number of sets of natural numbers [a,b,c,d,e] that can be produced with the numbers [0..n] such that the values of all the distinct parenthesized expressions of a-b-c-d-e are different.
%C A054026 There are 14 ways to put parentheses in the expression a - b - c - d - e: ((a - (b - c)) - d) - e, (((a - b) - c) - d) - e, ((a - b) - (c - d)) - e, etc. This sequence describes how many sets of natural numbers [a,b,c,d,e] can be produced with the numbers {0,1,2,3,...n} such that the values of all the distinct expressions are different.

%F A054026 Empirical formula: a(n) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * (27*n^4 -682*n^3 +6398*n^2 -26300*n +42193)/210. - _Jean-Fran√ßois Alcover_, Jan 20 2015
%e A054026 For example, no such sets can be produced with only 0's, only 0's and 1's, only 0's and 1's and 2's, only 1's and 2's and 3's; with {0,1,2,3,4}, 300 such sets can be produced.
