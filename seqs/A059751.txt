%N A059751 Grimm numbers (2): a(n) = largest k so that for each composite m in {n+1, n+2, ..., n+k} there corresponds a different divisor d_m with 1 < d_m < m.
%C A059751 Comment from _T. D. Noe_, Feb 18 2009: Erdős and Pomerance conjectured that the number n+a(n)+1, which "blocks" a(n) from becoming larger, is always an odd semiprime. They verified this conjecture up to n=492 and proved it for large n. The numbers n at which n+a(n)+1 increases also appear to be semiprimes.

%e A059751 For n=4 we look at the sequence {5, 6, 7, ... } and we must choose distinct proper divisors for as many composites as we can. We can choose 2 for 6, 4 for 8, 3 for 9, 5 for 10, 6 for 12 and 7 for 14, but now all the proper divisors of 15 have appeared, so we stop and a(4) = 14 - 4 = 10.
