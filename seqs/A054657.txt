%N A054657 Number of leaves on the rooted tree of height n constructed by the following rule. Assign weight 1 to the single node at height 1. At each node of weight w at height k>0, branch to nodes at height k+1 as follows: one node of weight 1 and a node of weight d+1 if d divides w.
%C A054657 If the condition "d divides w" in the definition is replaced by "d<=w" then sequence A000108 (the Catalan numbers) is obtained.
%K A054657 nonn
