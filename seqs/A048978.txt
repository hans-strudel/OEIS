%N A048978 Light numbers, those whose mean sum of divisors <= mean running sum of divisors of all previous n.
%F A048978 Keep running totals of sum, rs and number of divisors, rd, for all numbers to n-1. Divide rs by rd. If mean at n <= running mean at n-1, then number is "light, " else "heavy."
%e A048978 a(1)=360. At 360 rs/rd of all previous n is 105811/2162=48.94+. At 360, s/d is 1170/24=48.75. 48.75<=48.94 so 360 is "Light."
