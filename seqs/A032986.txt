%N A032986 Numbers n with property that all pairs of consecutive base 9 digits differ by more than 2.
%C A032986 Comments from Huen Yeong Kong (cosmology(AT)pacific.net.sg), Sep 19 2008 (Start): Consider the sequence with the first eight terms deleted: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 53, 54, 55, ...
%C A032986 This sequence extends to infinity starting from the first quintuplet cluster of 13,14,15,16,17 with higher clusters separated by multiples of 10 intervals. This sequence extended to infinity is completely devoid of twin primes.
%C A032986 Example: For n = 10, the sequence generated is: [[13, 14, 15, 16, 17], [23, 24, 25, 26, 27], [33, 34, 35, 36, 37], [43, 44, 45, 46, 47], [53, 54, 55, 56, 57], [63, 64, 65, 66, 67], [73, 74, 75, 76, 77], [83, 84, 85, 86, 87], [93, 94, 95, 96, 97]]
%C A032986 Using Macsyma Symbolic Software we can write: makelist( [6+i*10-10-3,6+i*10-10-2,6+i*10-10-1, 6+i*10-10, 6+i*10-10+1], i,2,n); (End)
