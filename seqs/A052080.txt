%N A052080 Concatenation of n consecutive descending numbers starting from a(n) produces the smallest possible prime of this form, 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A052080 First hard cases occur for n = 22, 88 and 110.
%C A052080 a(22) = 10^1631 + 10 was found by _James G. Merickel_ in Feb 2011.
%C A052080 a(88) = 10^14 + 6.
%C A052080 a(110) = 10^19 + 26 was found by Chris Nash.
