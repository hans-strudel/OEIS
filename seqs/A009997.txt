%N A009997 Number of comparative probability orderings on all subsets of n elements that can arise by assigning a probability distribution to the individual elements.
%C A009997 Also 1/(2^n*n!) * number of regions of hyperplane arrangements with normals (0,1,-1)^n.
%C A009997 From _David W. Wilson_, Aug 15 2008: (Start)
%C A009997 Also, number of possible orderings of the set of divisors of a product of n distinct primes.
%C A009997 Let p1 < p2 < ... < p_n be primes (say p1 = p, p2 = q, p3 = r, ...) Consider the set M of divisors of p1*p2*...*p_n. How many ways can M be ordered?
%C A009997 For n = 0, we have m = { 1 }, with 1 ordering.
%C A009997 For n = 1, we have M = { 1, p }. There is 1 possible ordering, 1 < p.
%C A009997 For n = 2, we have M = { 1, p, q, pq }. Remembering p < q, there is again 1 possible ordering, 1 < p < q < pq.
%C A009997 For n = 3, we have M = { 1, p, q, r, pq, pr, qr, pqr }. There are 2 possible orderings here:
%C A009997 1 < p < q < r < pq < pr < qr < pqr,
%C A009997 1 < p < q < pq < r < pr < qr < pqr. (End)
