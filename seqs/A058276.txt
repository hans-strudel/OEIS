%N A058276 Number of connected 6-regular simple graphs on n vertices with girth at least 4.
%C A058276 The null graph on 0 vertices is vacuously connected and 6-regular; since it is acyclic, it has infinite girth. [From _Jason Kimberley_, Jan 30 2011]
%C A058276 Other than at n=0, this sequence first differs from A184964 at n = A054760(6,5) = 40.
