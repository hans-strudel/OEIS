%N A050229 Numbers n such that for any x, 1<=x<=n-1, there is y, 0<=y<=n-2, such that x^2 (mod n) = 2^y (mod n).
%C A050229 It seems that the sequence consists of {1,2} union A001122. The sequence differs from A082595 because here the multiplicity is not important (see example: P contains two 5's and Q is required to have at least one 5, not necessarily 2 5's).
%C A050229 Numbers n for which there is a permutation of 0..n-1 such that each number is the sum of all the previous, plus 1, mod n. - _R. H. Hardin_, Dec 28 2007
%C A050229 Positive numbers n such that x^(n-1) + x^(n-2) + x^(n-3) + ... + x + 1 is irreducible over GF(2). - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Nov 20 2012
%C A050229 All entries > 1 are prime. Appears to be set of numbers k such that the sequence 2^n mod k has period length of k-1. - _Gary Detlefs_, May 15 2014
%F A050229 a(n) = A071642(n) + 1. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Nov 20 2012
%e A050229 The set of values for x^2 mod 19, 1<=x<=18, is P=[1, 4, 9, 16, 6, 17, 11, 7, 5, 5, 7, 11, 17, 6, 16, 9, 4, 1], the set of values for 2^y mod 19, 0<=y<=n-2 is Q= [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 13, 7, 14, 9, 18, 17, 15, 11, 3, 6, 12, 5, 10] which contains all values in P, hence 19 is in the sequence.
%o A050229 (PARI) for(n=1,450,if(sum(y=1,n-1,if(setsearch(Set(vector(n-1,x,2^(x-1)%n)),y),0,1))==0,print1(n,",")))
%Y A050229 Cf. A001122, A082595.
