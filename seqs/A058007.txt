%N A058007 Freestyle perfect numbers n = Product_{i=1,..,k} f_i^e_i where 1 < f_1 <  ... < f_k, e_i > 0, such that 2n = Product_{i=1,..,k} (f_i^(e_i+1)-1)/(f_i-1).
%C A058007 Only one odd freestyle perfect number is known: 198585576189, found by Descartes.
%C A058007 This sequence consists of perfect numbers A000396 and those which aren't, called spoof-perfect numbers A174292. Roughly said, a spoof-perfect number is a number that would be perfect if one or more of its composite factors were wrongly assumed to be prime, i.e., taken as a "spoof prime". - _Daniel Forgues_, Nov 15 2009 (slightly rephrased)
%C A058007 The right hand side of the second equation in the definition, 2n = ..., equals the sum of divisors sigma(n), if all of the f_i are distinct primes. If they aren't, there arise some ambiguities: See A174292 for further discussion. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 13 2013

%H A058007 OEIS wiki, <a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/Freestyle_perfect_numbers">Freestyle perfect numbers</a>.
%e A058007 n = 60 = (3^1)*(4^1)*(5^1), s = 120 = [(3^2-1)*(4^2-1)*(5^2-1)]/[(3-1)*(4-1)*(5-1)]. s-n = 120-60 = n. So 60 is in the sequence.
