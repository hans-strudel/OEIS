%N A001948 These numbers when multiplied by all powers of 4 give the numbers that are not the sums of 4 distinct squares.
%C A001948 See also the comment in sequence A004437: The only integers that cannot be partitioned into a sum of four distinct squares of nonnegative integers are 4^k x (A union B) where A = {1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,23,25,27,31,33,37,43,47,55,67,73,97,103} and B = {2,6,10,18,22,34,58,82}. - _M.
