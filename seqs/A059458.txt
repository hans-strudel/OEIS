%N A059458 A binary sequence: a(1) = 10 (2 in decimal) and a(n+1) is obtained by trying to complement just one bit of a(n), starting with the least significant bit, until a new prime is reached.
%C A059458 This is the lexicographically least (in positions of the flipped bits) such sequence.
%C A059458 It is not known if the sequence is infinite.
%p A059458 See A059459 for Maple program.
%Y A059458 The decimal sequence is given in A059459. A base-ten analog is in A059471.
