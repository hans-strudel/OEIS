%N A023805 Xenodromes: all digits in base 11 are different.
%C A023805 Considering some base b, there are b numbers with 1 digit, (b-1)*(b-1) numbers with 2 digits -- since leading 0's are not allowed and the second digit must avoid the first. There are (b-1)*(b-1)*(b-2) numbers with 3 digits, (b-1)*(b-1)*(b-2)*..*(b-d+1) numbers with d digits, in total b+(b-1)*sum_{d=2..b} (b-1)!/(b-d)! = b+(b-1)^2* 2F0(1,2-b;;-1) = A001339(b-1). The formula is applicable to sequences A023798 - A023810. This sequence here as A001339(11-1) = 98641011 terms. [From _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 27 2010]
%C A023805 Last term is a(98641011) = 282458553905. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jun 16 2012
