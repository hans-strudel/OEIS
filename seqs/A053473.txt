%N A053473 Cototient of n (A051953) iterated 5 times.
%C A053473 As iteration of A051953 progresses, more and more powers of 2 and 0 appear. The fixed point is 0 . Analogous 5th iterates for A000005 or A000010 are A036453 and A049107
%e A053473 n=50, n_1=n-phi(n)=50-20=30, n_2=n_1-Phi[n_1]=30-8=22, n_3=22-Phi[22]=12, n_4 = n_3-Phi[n_3]=12-4=8, n_5=8-Phi[8]=4 so the 50th term is 4.
%Y A053473 A051953, A000005, A000010, A036453, A049107.
