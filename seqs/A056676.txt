%N A056676 Number of non-unitary but squarefree divisors of binomial(n,floor(n/2)). Also number of nonsquarefree but unitary divisors of binomial(n,floor(n/2)).
%F A056676 a(n) = A039593(n) - A000005(A055231(x)) = A039593(n) - A000005(A007913(x)/A055229(x)), where x = A001405(n) = binomial(n, floor(n/2)).
%e A056676 n=14, C(14,7)=3432, has 32 divisors, 16 unitary, 16 squarefree. The size of overlap is 8. The complementary parts are: non-unitary/squarefree set={2,6,22,26,66,78,286,828}, while the unitary/not squarefree set of equal size is {8,24,88,104,264,312,1144,3432}. So a(14)=8.
%Y A056676 Cf. A039593, A000005, A055231, A007913, A055229, A001405.
