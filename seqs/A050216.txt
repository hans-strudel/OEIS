%N A050216 Number of primes between (prime(n))^2 and (prime(n+1))^2, with a(0) = 2 by convention.
%C A050216 The function in Brocard's Conjecture, which states that for n >= 2, a(n) >= 4.
%C A050216 The lines in the graph correspond to prime gaps of 2, 4, 6, ... .  - _T. D. Noe_, Feb 04 2008
%C A050216 Lengths of blocks of consecutive primes in A000430 (union of primes and squares of primes). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Sep 23 2011
%C A050216 In the n-th step of the sieve of Eratosthenes, all multiples of prime(n) are removed. Then a(n) gives the number of new primes obtained after the n-th step. - _Jean-Christophe Herv√©_, Oct 27 2013
%C A050216 More precisely, after the n-th step, one is sure to have eliminated all composites less than prime(n+1)^2, since any composite N has a prime factor <= sqrt(N). It is in exactly this (restricted) sense that a(n) yields the number of "new primes" (additional numbers known to be prime) after the n-th step. But one knows after the n-th step also that all remaining numbers between prime(n+1)^2 and prime(n+1)*(prime(n+1)+2) are prime: By construction they don't have a factor less than prime(n+1) and they don't have a factor prime(n+1) so the least prime factor could be prime(n+2) >= prime(n+1)+2. For example, after eliminating multiples of 3 in the 2nd step, one has (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, ...) and one knows that all remaining numbers strictly in between 5^2=25 and 5*(5+2)=35 are prime, too. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 31 2014
%C A050216 Numerically, the slope of the lowest "ray" m(n) = min {a(k); k>n}, seems to converge to a value somewhere in the range 1.75 < m(n)/n < 1.8; with m(n)/n > 1.7 for n > 900, m(n)/n > 1.75 for n > 2700. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 31 2014
%C A050216 Legendre's conjecture (see A014085) would imply that a(n) >= 2 for all n and that sequences A054272, A250473 and A250474 were thus strictly increasing (see the Wikipedia article about Brocard's conjecture). - _Antti Karttunen_, Jan 01 2015
