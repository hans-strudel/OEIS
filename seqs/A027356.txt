%N A027356 Array read by rows: T(n,k) = number of partitions of n into distinct odd parts in which k is the greatest part, for k=1,2,...,n, n>=1.
%C A027356 First T(n,k) not 0 or 1 is T(17,9)=2, which counts 1+7+9 and 3+5+9. Row sums: A000700.
%F A027356 T(n, 1)=0 for all n; T(n, n)=1 for all odd n>1; and for n>=3, T(n, k)=0 if k is even, else T(n, k)=Sum{T(n-k, i): i=1, 2, ..., n-1} for k=2, 3, ..., n-1.

%e A027356 E.g. final 2 counts these two partitions: 9+31 and 1+3+5+31.
