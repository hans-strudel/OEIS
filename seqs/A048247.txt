%N A048247 Every prime occurs to this power in some factorial.
%C A048247 There are no primes in the sequence, as the prime p fails the base p test. The set of positive integers failing the base p test for membership has density 1/p. Also, when n is a nonmember of the set, any base p whose test n fails has p<=n. Therefore one conjectural estimate for the number of members of the set <=x would be x*product{primes p<=x}(1-1/p) ~ e^(-gamma)*x/log(x). However, a similar heuristic for the primes fails, as pi(x) ~ x/log(x) and not e^(-gamma)*x/log(x). Here gamma denotes the Euler-Mascheroni constant. - _David L. Harden_, Aug 24 2002

%F A048247 Numbers passing the test for membership for the base p are generated by W_p(x) = product_{n=1..inf} (x^(p*(p^n-1)/(p-1))-1)/(x^((p^n-1)/(p-1))-1). - _David L. Harden_
%e A048247 Given any prime p, there exists a positive integer n such that p|n! but p^2 does not divide n!.
%e A048247 Given any prime p, there exists a positive integer n such that p^4|n! but p^5 does not divide n!.
%e A048247 But it is not true that given any prime p, there exists a positive integer n such that p^6|n! but p^7 does not divide n! (for if 64|n! then 128|n!).
%e A048247 For every prime p there is an n such that p^4|n! but p^5 doesn't divide n!: for p=2, we may take n=6; for p=3, we may take n=9; for p>4, we may take n=4p.
