%N A058811 Number of terms on the n-th level of the Inverse-Totient-Tree (ITT). The 0th, 1st, 2nd and 3rd levels are {1}, {2}, {3, 4, 6}, {5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18} with 1, 1, 3, 8 entries resp. The (n+1)-st level is obtained from the n-th level as the union of the inverse phi sets of the terms occurring earlier on the n-th level.
%C A058811 Level 0 is the set {1}, and level k>=1 is the set of numbers t such that phi(t) is in the set of level k; a(n) is the cardinality of the set in level n. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jan 07 2015
%C A058811 The 3rd level is {5, 8, 10, 12, 7, 9, 14, 18} and a(3)=8. Generate invphi(5)={}, .., invphi(12)={13, 21, 26, 28, 36, 42}, ..., invphi(14)={}, .. The union of these inverses gives the 4th Floor ={15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 11, 22, 13, 21, 26, 28, 36, 42, 19, 27, 38, 54}, which has 17 terms. So a(4)=17. Each level-set may have entries either from A007617, A005278 (initial nodes of the tree) or from A000010 (invphi-continuable numbers).
%C A058811 Results of Shapiro show that largest number in the n-th level is 2*3^(n-1). The Mathematica code first computes A003434(k) for k <= 2*3^(n-1); then it gives the number of numbers k for which A003434(k) = n. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 08 2004

%F A058811 a(n) = Cardinality[Floor(n)], where Floor(0)={1}, Floor(n+1)=Union[invphi(t(i, n)), i=1..a(n))], where t(i, n) is the i-th integer in Floor(n), ordered by size or lexicographically.
