%N A007964 Numbers n such that product of proper divisors of n is <= n; i.e. product of divisors of n is <= n^2.
%C A007964 Smarandache and others call these "simple numbers".
%C A007964 Numbers which are the product of up to two primes (not necessarily distinct) or the cube of a prime. Alternatively, numbers having prime decomposition p*q, where q either is distinct from p or equals p^k for 0<=k<=2.
%C A007964 Corresponds to numbers having at most four divisors. (For numbers with exactly four divisors see A030513.) - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Sep 23 2003
%C A007964 For n>3: numbers that can occur as fourth divisors; union of A000040, A001248, A006881 and A030078. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, May 15 2006
