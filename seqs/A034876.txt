%N A034876 Number of ways to write n! as a product of smaller factorials each greater than 1.
%C A034876 By definition, a(n)>0 if and only if n is a member of A034878. If n>2, then a(n!)>max(a(n),a(n!-1)), as (n!)!=n!*(n!-1)!. Similarly, a(A001013(n))>0 for n>2. Clearly a(n)=0 if n is a prime A000040. So a(n+1)=1 if n=2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime A000668, as (n+1)!=(2!)^p*n! and n is prime. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 15 2004
