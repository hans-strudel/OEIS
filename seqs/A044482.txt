%N A044482 Numbers n such that string 4,4 occurs in the base 5 representation of n but not of n+1.
%C A044482 a(n)+1 is divisible by 25 because the string 4,4 must be at the lower end of the base 5 representation. [Joerg Arndt, Feb 13 2012]

%e A044482 49 is in the sequence because its base 5 representation, 144, includes 44 as a substring, but the base 5 representation of 50, 200, does not.
%e A044482 599 is not in the sequence because, although it is 4344 in base 5, 600 is 4400 in base 5.
%t A044482 f[n_]:= Length[StringPosition[ToString[FromDigits[IntegerDigits[n,5]]],"44",1]]; Select[Table[n,{n,2000}],f[#]>0&&f[#+1] == 0&] (* _Vincenzo Librandi_, Feb 12 2012 *)
