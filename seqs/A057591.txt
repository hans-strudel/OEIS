%N A057591 Maximal size of binary code of length n that corrects 2 deletions.
%C A057591 Comments from Pablo San Segundo, Dec 04 2015 (Start): The search for a maximal clique in the graph 2dc.2048 has now finished. The answer is 24 (which was already known to be a lower bound).
%C A057591 The total time was 16.4 days using a 20-core XEON with 128Gb. 18 cores out of the 20 were in fact used.
%C A057591 The solution was found by a strong heuristic algorithm during pre-processing (about 5s). The actual search time was used “only” to prove optimality. The actual maximum clique algorithm is our most recent variant based on infra-chromatic BBMCX, described here, but as yet unpublished: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pablo_San_Segundo
%C A057591 The project was carried out by Pablo San Segundo and Jorge Artieda, Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM), Center of Automation and Robotics (CAR). Supported by National Grant DPI 2014-53525-C3-1-R (End)
