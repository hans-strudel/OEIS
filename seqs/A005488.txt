%N A005488 Maximal number of edges in a b^{hat} graceful graph with n nodes.
%C A005488 A graph with e edges is 'b^{hat} graceful' if its nodes can be labeled with distinct nonnegative integers so that, if each edge is labeled with the absolute difference between the labels of its endpoints, then the e edges have the distinct labels 1, 2, ..., e.
%C A005488 Equivalently, maximum m for which there's a difference basis with respect to m with n elements. A 'difference basis w.r.t. m' is a set of integers such that every integer from 1 to m is a difference between two elements of the set.

%E A005488 Miller's paper gives these lower bounds for the 11 terms from a(9) to a(19): 29,37,45,51,61,70,79,93,101,113,127. (Bermond's paper gives these as exact values, but quotes Miller as their source.)
