%N A035232 Number of substrings of n which are primes.
%C A035232 No leading 0's allowed in substrings.
%e A035232 The primes occurring as substrings of 37 are 3, 7, 37, so a(37)=3. a(22)=2, since the prime 2 occurs twice as a substring.
%t A035232 a[n_] := Block[{s = IntegerDigits[n], c = 0, d = {}}, l = Length[s]; t = Flatten[ Table[ Take[s, {i, j}], {i, 1, l}, {j, i, l}], 1]; k = l(l + 1)/2; While[k > 0, If[ t[[k]][[1]] != 0, d = Append[d, FromDigits[ t[[k]] ]]]; k-- ]; Count[ PrimeQ[d], True]]; Table[ a[n], {n, 1, 105}]
