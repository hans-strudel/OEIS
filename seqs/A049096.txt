%N A049096 Numbers n such that 2^n + 1 is divisible by a square > 1.
%C A049096 Conjecture: lim n -> infinity a(n)/n = C exists and 4 < C < 9/2. There seems to be a sequence of primes p such that p^2 never divides numbers of the form 2^x + 1: the first few are 2, 7, 23, 31. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Aug 20 2002
%C A049096 That sequence is A072936. - _Robert Israel_, Nov 20 2015
%C A049096 The first case where 2^n + 1 is divisible by a square that is coprime to n is n = 182 (where 2^182 + 1 is divisible by 1093^2). - _Robert Israel_, Jul 07 2014
%C A049096 From _Robert Israel_, Nov 20 2015: (Start)
%C A049096 Numbers n such that gcd(n, 2^n + 1) > 1 or n = k m where k is odd and 2 m is the order of 2 modulo a Wieferich prime.  See link "When p^2 divides 2^n + 1".
%C A049096 If n is in the sequence, then so is k*n for any odd k. (End)
%H A049096 Robert Israel, <a href="/A049096/a049096.pdf">When p^2 divides 2^n + 1</a>
%F A049096 For any a(n+1) - a(n) <= 6 since numbers of form 3^a*(2k+1) a > 0, k >= 0, are in the sequence (2^(3*(2k+1) + 1 is divisible by 9). So are numbers of the form 20k + 10 since 2^(20k+10) + 1 is divisible by 25, 110k + 55 since 2^(110k+55) + 1 is divisible by 11^2, 78 + 156k since 2^(156k+78) + 1 is divisible by 13^2 ... - _Benoit Cloitre_, Aug 20 2002
%e A049096 9 is here because 2^9 + 1 = 513 is divisible by a square, 9.
%e A049096 99 is here because 2^99 + 1 = 3^3 * 19 * 67 * 683 * 5347 * 20857 * 242099935645987 is divisible by 3^2, i.e. is not squarefree.
