%N A054500 Indicator sequence for classification of nonattacking queens on n X n toroidal board.
%C A054500 The three sequences A054500/A054501/A054502 are used to classify solutions to the problem of "Nonattacking queens on a 2n+1 X 2n+1 toroidal board" by their symmetry; solutions are considered equivalent iff they differ only by rotation, reflection or torus shift.
%C A054500 For brevity, let i(n) = A054500(n) (indicator sequence), m(n) = A054501(n) (multiplicity) and c(n) = A054502(n) (count).
%C A054500 i(n) = k means that there are solutions for the kXk board and that m(n) and c(n) refer to it. There are c(n) inequivalent solutions which may be extended to m(n) different representations each (i.e. m(n) permutations).
%C A054500 This gives two formulae: A007705(n) = Sum (c(k) * m(k)), A053994(n) = Sum (c(k)), where the sum is taken over all k for which i(k) = 2n+1, for both formulae. Note that m(n) is always a divisor of 8 * i(n)^2.

%e A054500 For a 19 X 19 toroidal board, you have three entries in the indicator sequence A054500; their count terms (A054502) give 354 = 4 + 132 + 218 inequivalent solutions; together with their multiplicity (A054501) they add up to 4 * 76 + 132 * 1444 + 218 * 2888 = 820496 solutions at all.
