%N A035307 a(n)=least integer such that every even unimodular lattice in dimension 8n contains some vectors of all even (squared) norm >= 2*a(n).
%C A035307 a(4) and a(5) are determined by Odlyzko and Sloane, a(6) by Peters and Kok Seng Chua gives an explicit upper bound for all a(n). Also both a(7) and a(8) are either 2 or 3 as established by Chakraborty et al.
