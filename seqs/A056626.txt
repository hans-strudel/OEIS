%N A056626 Number of non-unitary square divisors of n.
%F A056626 a(n)=A046951(n)-2^r, where r is the number of prime factors in the largest unitary prime divisor of n.
%e A056626 n=p^u prime-power has u+1 square-divisors of which 2 (i.e. 1 and n) are unitary but u-1 are not unitary, so a[p^u]=u-1. E.g. n=4^4=256, has 5 square divisors {1,4,16,64,256} of which {4,16,64} are not unitary, so a(256)=3.
