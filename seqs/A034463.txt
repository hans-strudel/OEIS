%N A034463 Maximal number of residue classes mod n such that no subset adds to 0.
%C A034463 From _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jun 13 2010: (Start)
%C A034463 Given a value of n, one way to obtain a set of residue classes having no zero subset sum is simply to select the first k positive integers, where k is the largest integer such that sum(1..k)<n; for any n>0, this yields a set of k residue classes where k=round(sqrt(2n))-1, which serves as a first lower bound for a(n).
%C A034463 For n>5, another simple method is to select the residue classes 1, n-2, and 3..k, where k is the largest integer such that sum(1..k)-2<n; this yields a set of k residue classes where k=round(sqrt(2n+4))-1. This second lower bound for a(n) is an improvement over the first bound at n=6,9,10,14,15,20,21,... (i.e., values of n that are triangular numbers or one less than triangular numbers; these are the terms of A117142 that exceed 5).
%C A034463 For even values of n, a third method is to select residue classes m=n/2, 1, m+1, 2, m+2, 3, m+3, etc., until k=floor(sqrt(2n-3)) residue classes have been selected. This third lower bound for a(n) is an improvement over the other two for n=26,34,42,52,62,64,74,76,86,88,100,102,114,116,118,... (i.e., even numbers whose difference d from the next higher triangular number T(k)=k*(k+1)/2 satisfies 1 < d < k/2-1).
%C A034463 Let S={25,75,375,525,1125,1375,...} be the set of numbers that are 25 times an odd triangular number, i.e., numbers of the form 25*T(j)=25*j*(j+1)/2 where (j+3) mod 4 < 2. For values of n in S, a fourth method is to let m=n/5 and select residue classes 1..j, m+1..m+j, 2*m+1..2*m+j, 3*m+1..3*m+j, 4*m+1..4*m+j, m, and 2*m; this yields a set of 5*j+2 residue classes, which gives sqrt(2n + 25/4)-1/2 as an improved lower bound for a(n) for n in S: a(25)>=7, a(75)>=12, a(375)>=27, a(525)>=32, a(1125)>=47, a(1375)>=52, etc.
%C A034463 For each of the first 87 terms in the sequence, an exhaustive search determined that a(n) either equals the first lower bound (round(sqrt(2n))-1) or exceeds it by only 1, and that at least one of the four methods above yields a maximal solution.
%C A034463 The sequence is not nondecreasing; a(n)<a(n-1) at n=43, 53, 63, and 87 (and, if it continues to be the case that at least one of the four methods above yields a maximal solution, the next decreases occur at n=89,101,103,115,117,131,133,147,149,151,...).
%C A034463 Does there exist any value of n for which none of the four methods above yields a maximal solution? (End)
