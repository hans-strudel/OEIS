%N A055382 Smallest prime starting a sequence of 2n consecutive odd primes with symmetrical gaps about the center.
%H A055382 Discussion at the scientific forum dxdy.ru, <a href="http://dxdy.ru/post1035725.html#p1035725">Distributed computing project</a> (in Russian)
%F A055382 For n>1, a(n) = A081235(n) = A175309(2n-1).
%e A055382 The first term is 3 since the 2 primes 3, 5 have a gap of 2, which is trivially symmetric about its center.
%e A055382 The second term is 5 since the 4 primes 5, 7, 11, 13 have gaps 2, 4, 2, which is symmetric about its center.
%e A055382 The twelve primes 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193 have gaps 2, 10, 2, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 2, 10, 2 - symmetric about the middle, so a(6) = 137.
%Y A055382 Cf. A001223, A055380, A055381, A175309.
