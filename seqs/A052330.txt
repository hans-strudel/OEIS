%N A052330 Let S_k denote the first 2^k terms of this sequence and let b_k be the smallest positive integer that is not in S_k; then the numbers b_k*S_k are the next 2^k terms.
%C A052330 Inverse of sequence A064358 considered as a permutation of the positive integers. - _Howard A. Landman_, Sep 25 2001
%C A052330 This sequence is not exactly a permutation because it has offset 0 but doesn't contain 0. A052331 is its exact inverse, which has offset 1 and contains 0. See also A064358.
%C A052330 Are there any other values of n besides 4 and 36 with a(n) = n? - _Thomas Ordowski_, Apr 01 2005
%C A052330 4=100=4^1*3^0*2^0, 36=100100=9^1*7^0*5^0*4^1*3^0*2^0. - _Thomas Ordowski_, May 26 2005
%C A052330 Ordering of positive integers by increasing "Fermi-Dirac representation", which is a representation of the "Fermi-Dirac factorization", term implying that each prime power with a power of two as exponent may appear at most once in the "Fermi-Dirac factorization" of n.

%F A052330 a(0)=1; a(n+2^k)=a(n)*b(k) for n<2^k, k=0, 1, ... where b is A050376. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Mar 04 2005
%F A052330 The binary representation of n, n = Sum(i=0..1+floor(log_2(n)) n_i * 2^i, n_i in {0,1}, is taken as the "Fermi-Dirac representation" (A182979) of a(n), a(n) = Prod(i=0..1+floor(log_2(n)) (b_i)^(n_i) where b_i is A050376(i), i.e., the i-th "Fermi-Dirac prime" (prime power with exponent being a power of 2). - _Daniel Forgues_, Feb 12 2011
