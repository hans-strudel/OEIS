%N A060585 Write n in base 3, then (working from left to right) if the k-th digit of n is equal to the corresponding digit to the left of the k-th digit of a(n) then 1 is the k-th digit of a(n), otherwise the k-th digit of a(n) is 0, then read result as a base 2 number.
%C A060585 A ternary to binary switch.
%F A060585 a(n) = 2a([n/3])+A060584(n) = A060586(A060587(n)).
%e A060585 a(76) = 10 since 76 written in base 3 is 2211 and looking for changing digits produces 1010 which read as if in binary is 10.
%Y A060585 k appears A001316(k) times in the sequence.
%K A060585 base,nonn
%O A060585 0,4
