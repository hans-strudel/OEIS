%N A059772 Smallest prime p such that n is a solution mod p of x^2 = 2, or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A059772 Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p-1. The following equivalences hold for n > 1: There is a prime p such that n is a solution mod p of x^2 = 2 iff n^2-2 has a prime factor > n; n is a solution mod p of x^2 = 2 iff p is a prime factor of n^2-2 and p > n. n^2-2 has at most one prime factor > n, consequently such a factor is the only prime p such that n is a solution mod p of x^2 = 2. For n such that n^2-2 has no prime factor > n (the zeros in the sequence), cf. A060515.

%F A059772 If n^2-2 has a (unique) prime factor p > n, then a(n) = p, else a(n) = 0.
%e A059772 a(11) = 17, since 11 is a solution mod 17 of x^2 = 2 and 11 is not a solution mod p of x^2 = 2 for primes p < 17. Although 11^2 = 2 mod 7, prime 7 is excluded because 7 < 11 and 11 = 4 mod 7.
