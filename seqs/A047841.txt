%N A047841 Autobiographical numbers: Fixed under operator T (A047842): "Say what you see".
%C A047841 A digit count numerically summarizes the frequency of digits 0 through 9 in that order when they occur in a number.
%C A047841 This uses a different method from A108810. Here the digits are described in increasing order, whereas in A108810 they can be described in any order.
%C A047841 This sequence is finite, since T(x) < x for every x with at least 22 digits. Last term is a(109) = 101112213141516171819. - Schimke
%C A047841 A character in the Verghese (2009) novel declares that 10213223 "is the only number that describes itself when you read it." - _Alonso del Arte_, Jan 26 2014
%D A047841 J. N. Kapur, Reflections of a Mathematician, Chapter 33, pp. 314-318, Arya Book Depot, New Delhi 1996.

%e A047841 10313314 contains 1 0's, 3 1's, 3 3's and 1 4's, hence T(10313314) = 10313314 is in the sequence
%e A047841 The entry 3122331418, for instance, is a member since it is indeed made up of three 1's, two 2's, three 3's, one 4 and one 8.
%Y A047841 Cf. A005151, which is the sequence 1, T(1), T(T(1)), .. ending in the fixed-point 21322314.
%Y A047841 Cf. A104785, A104786, A104787, A108810.
