%N A059809 Numbers that do not contain exactly the same digits in two different smaller bases.
%C A059809 Also numbers that cannot be expressed as the two-digit numbers a b (base r) and b a (base s) for two different smaller bases r and s (i.e., 2-digit "reversals"), and the numbers that cannot be expressed as "reversals" of any length for two different smaller bases. I can prove this. - _Francis J. McDonnell_, Jul 28 2015
