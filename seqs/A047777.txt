%N A047777 Primes seen in decimal expansion of Pi (disregarding the decimal period) contiguous, smallest and distinct.
%C A047777 Sequence A121267 gives the number of digits of a(n) [but see also A229181 for a variant, cf. below]. The terms a(9)-a(11) had been found by Chris Nash in Oct. 1999, and primality of the 3057-digit term a(9) has been proved by J. K. Andersen in Sept. 2002, who also found the next 5 terms a(12)-a(16) and the bound a(17) > 10^32000, cf. Rivera's web page "Problem 18". - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 31 2013
%C A047777 There is a natural variant of the present sequence, using the same definition except for not requiring that all primes have to be distinct. That variant would have the same 3057-digit prime as next term, and therefore have the same displayed terms and not justify a second entry in OEIS. However, terms beyond a(9) would be different: instead of 73, 467 and the 14650-digit PRP, it would be followed by 7, 3, 467, 2, 2, and a 748-digit prime. Sequence A229181 yields the size of these terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 15 2013
