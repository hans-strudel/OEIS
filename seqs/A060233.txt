%N A060233 A list of equal temperaments (equal divisions of the octave) whose nearest scale steps are closer and closer approximations to six complementary pairs of ratios which generate simple musical tones (scale steps): 8/7 and 7/4, 6/5 and 5/3, 16/13 and 13/8, 5/4 and 8/5, 4/3 and 3/2 and 11/8 and 16/11.
%C A060233 The sequence was found by a computer search of all the equal divisions of the octave from 1 to over 31737. The numerical value of each term represents a musical scale based on an equal division of the octave. 19, for example, signifies the scale which is formed by dividing the octave into 19 equal parts.
%F A060233 Recurrence: The next term equals the current term plus one or more of the previous terms: a(n+1) = a(n) + a(n-x)... + a(n-y)... + a(n-z), etc.
%e A060233 6 = 4 + the previous term 2. Again, 48545 = 46625 + the previous terms (1578 + 270 + 72).
%Y A060233 A054540, A060525, A060526, A060527, A060528, A060529, A001149, A000045.
