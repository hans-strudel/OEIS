%N A049414 Number of quasi-initially connected digraphs with n labeled nodes.
%C A049414 We say that a node v of a digraph is a quasi-source iff for every other node u there exists directed path from u to v or from v to u. A digraph with at least one quasi-source is called quasi-initially connected.
