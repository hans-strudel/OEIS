%N A061539 Signed permutations in B_n which correspond to smooth Schubert varieties. These permutations avoid the following patterns: (-2 -1) (1 2 -3) (1 -2 -3) (-1 2 -3) (2 -1 -3) (-2 1 -3) (3 -2 1) (2 -4 3 1) (-2 -4 3 1) (3412) (3 4 -1 2) (-3 4 1 2) (4 1 3 -2) (4 -1 3 -2) (4 2 3 1) (4 2 3 -1) (-4 2 3 1).
%C A061539 A signed permutation w corresponds to a matrix with exactly one nonzero entry in each row and column and that entry is either 1 or -1. A signed permutation avoids the pattern (1 2 -3) if no three rows and three columns gives a submatrix with diagonal entries 1 1 -1.

%e A061539 a(2) = 7 because there are 8 signed permutations of two elements and there is exactly one bad pattern of length 2.
