%N A006447 Consider a 2-D cellular automaton generated by the Schrandt-Ulam rule of A170896, but confined to a semi-infinite strip of width n, starting with one ON cell at the top left corner; a(n) is the period of the resulting structure.
%C A006447 Schrandt and Ulam remark that there seems to be no simple relation between n and a(n).
%C A006447 The original report included two further terms, but they were omitted from the published version, so are presumably unreliable.
