%N A053289 First differences of consecutive perfect powers (A001597).
%C A053289 M. Waldschmidt writes: Conjecture 1.3 (Pillai). Let k be a positive integer. The equation x^p - y^q = k where the unknowns x, y, p and q take integer values, all >= 2, has only finitely many solutions (x,y,p,q). This means that in the increasing sequence of perfect powers [A001597] the difference between two consecutive terms [the present sequence] tends to infinity. It is not even known whether for, say, k=2, Pillai's equation has only finitely many solutions. A related open question is whether the number 6 occurs as a difference between two perfect powers.
