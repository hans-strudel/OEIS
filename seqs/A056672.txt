%N A056672 Number of unitary and squarefree divisors of n! Also, number of divisors of the special squarefree part of n!, A055773(n).
%C A056672 The divisor d=1 is counted here as being free of prime divisors and also unitary.
%F A056672 a(n)=A000005[A055231(n!)]=A000005[A007913(n!)/A055229(n!)]= a(n)=A000005[A055773(n)]
%e A056672 n=11, 11!=2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.3.3.3.3.5.5.7.11, has 540 divisors, 32 are unitary and 32 are squarefree. Only 4 divisors, {1,7,11,77} have both properties, so a(11)=4.
