%N A047845 (n-1)/2, where n runs through odd nonprimes (A014076).
%C A047845 Also (starting with 2nd term) numbers of the form 2xy+x+y for x and y positive integers. This is also the numbers of sticks needed to construct a two dimensional rectangular lattice of unit squares. See A090767 for the three-dimensional generalization. - _John H. Mason_, Feb 02 2004
%C A047845 Note that if k is not in this sequence, then 2*k+1 is prime. - Jose Brox (tautocrona(AT)terra.es), Dec 29 2005
%C A047845 Values of n for which A073610(2n+3)=0; Values of n for which A061358(2n+3)=0; - _Graeme McRae_, Jul 18 2006
%C A047845 This sequence also arises in the following way: take the product of initial odd numbers i.e. the product (2n+1)!/(n!2^n) and factor it into prime numbers. The result will be of the form 3^n(3)5^n(5)7^n(7)11^n(11).... . Then n(3)/n(5) = 2, n(3)/n(7) = 3,n(3)/n(11) = 5,... and this sequence forms (for sufficiently large n, of course) the sequence of natural numbers without 4,7,10,12,... i.e. these numbers are what is lacking in the present sequence. - Andrzej Staruszkiewicz (uszkiewicz(AT)poczta.onet.pl), Nov 10 2007
%C A047845 Let p odd prime, number in sequence, n=(p^2-1)/2 (4,12,24,60,84,...). [_Vincenzo Librandi_, Aug 06 2010]
%C A047845 A193773(a(n)) > 1 for n > 1. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jan 02 2013
%C A047845 Also "flag short numbers", i.e., number of dots that can be arranged in successive rows of K, K+1, K, K+1, K, ..., K+1, K (assuming there is a total of L > 1 rows of size K > 0). Adapting Skip Garibaldi's terms, sequence A053726 would be "flag long numbers" because those patterns begin and end with the long lines. If you convert dots to sticks, you get the lattice that John H. Mason mentioned. - _Juhani Heino_, Oct 11 2014
