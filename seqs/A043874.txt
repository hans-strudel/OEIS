%N A043874 Numbers n such that number of runs in the base 4 representation of n is congruent to 7 mod 10.
%C A043874 Superset of A043598. Differs from A043865, from A043857 and from A043843 because numbers with run lengths of 17, 16, 15 or 14 clearly exist which are in only one these sequences. [From _R. J. Mathar_, Oct 20 2008]
