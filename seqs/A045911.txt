%N A045911 Neither a cube nor the sum of a nonnegative cube and a prime.
%C A045911 Numbers of the form 1 + k^3, as {9, 28, 65, 126, 217, 344, 513, 730, 1001, 1332, 1729, ...}, are allowed unless they can also be expressed as p + j^3 for some prime p (thus excluding {344, 513, 1001, 1729, ...}). - _Daniel Forgues_, Feb 13 2013
%C A045911 Contribution from _Daniel Forgues_, Feb 15 2013. (Start)
%C A045911 The graph seems to suggest either that (is there a conjecture?):
%C A045911   * the sequence grows extremely fast (fewer and fewer integers survive),
%C A045911   * the sequence is finite (at some point, no more integers survive).
%C A045911 If the sequence is not finite, what then is the asymptotic behavior?
%C A045911 Growth pattern (why is there an exponential growth interlude?):
%C A045911   * up to about n = 2000 the growth is subexponential (from slightly superlinear, progressing towards exponential growth),
%C A045911   * from about n = 2000 to 5000 the growth is nearly exponential,
%C A045911   * above n = 5000 the growth becomes superexponential (taking off from exponential growth) (there might be a last finite integer term!). (end)
%D A045911 Computed by James Van Buskirk, who finds 6195 solutions between 0 and 3000000000.
