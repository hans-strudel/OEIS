%N A061094 The alternating group A_n contains an element x which is not conjugate to its inverse (equivalently not all the entries in the character table of A_n are real numbers).
%C A061094 Every n >= 15 belongs to this sequence, i.e. the complement of this sequence is the finite sequence 1,2,5,6,10,14 for which all the entries in the character table of A_n are real.
