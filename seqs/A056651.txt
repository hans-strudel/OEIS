%N A056651 Numbers n such that binomial(n,floor(n/2)) has no non-unitary square divisors: all of their square divisors are unitary ones.
%C A056651 This property is weaker than "squarefreedom", but shows how central binomial coefficients are "poor of squares".
%H A056651 T. D. Noe, <a href="/A056651/b056651.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..129</a> (no others < 10^8)
%e A056651 n=223, x=binomial[223,111] has 35 prime divisors. 33 arises at power 1. Only 2 and 13 has powers 2>1. So square divisors of x are {1,4,169,676}={s}. All of them are also unitary divisors since GCD[s,x/s]=1 holds for them.
%Y A056651 Cf. A046098, A056175, A110495.
