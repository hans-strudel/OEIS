%N A054540 A list of equal temperaments (equal divisions of the octave) whose nearest scale steps are closer and closer approximations to the six simple ratios of musical harmony: 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5 and 5/3.
%C A054540 The sequence was found by a computer search of all of the equal divisions of the octave from 1 to over 3985011. There seems to be a hidden aspect or mystery here: what is it about the more and more harmonious equal temperaments that causes them to express themselves collectively as a perfect, self-accumulating recurrent sequence?
%F A054540 Stochastic recurrence rule - the next term equals the current term plus one or more previous terms: a(n+1) = a(n) + a(n-x)... + a(n-y)... + a(n-z), etc.
%e A054540 34 = 31 + the earlier term 3. Again, 118 = 53 + the earlier terms 34 and 31.
%Y A054540 Cf. A001149, A018065, A001856, A002858, A007335, A060525-A060527.
%K A054540 nonn
%O A054540 0,2
