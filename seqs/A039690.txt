%N A039690 Ambitious numbers: numbers n with the property that if a number ends in n then it is divisible by n.
%C A039690 Number whose 10's complement is a multiple of it. 125 is a member as its 10's complement is 1000-125 = 875= 125*7 - _Amarnath Murthy_, Mar 08 2002
%D A039690 P. J. Davis and R. Hersh, The Mathematical Experience, Birkhaeuser, Boston and Basel, 1981; see pp. 293-298.
%H A039690 Problem of the week, <a href="http://mathforum.org/wagon">Web site</a> - problem 881
%H A039690 <a href="/index/Rec">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (0,0,0,0,10).
%F A039690 Consists of the numbers 1, 2, 5, 25 or 125 times a power of 10.
%e A039690 If a number ends in 2 then it is even and so is divisible by 2, so 2 is in the sequence.
