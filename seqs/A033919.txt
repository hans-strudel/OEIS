%C A033919 Related to the Sierpiński number problem.
%C A033919 In an archived website, Payam Samidoost gives these numbers and other results about the dual Sierpiński problem. It is conjectured that, for each of these k<78557, there is an m such that k+2^m is prime. Then a covering argument would show that 78557 is the least odd number such that 78557+2^m is composite for all m. The impediment in the "dual" problem is that it is currently very difficult to prove the primality of large numbers of the form k+2^m. It is much easier to prove the Proth primes of the form k*2^m+1 which occur in the usual Sierpiński problem. According to the distributed search project "Five or Bust", 40291 is the only value of k < 78557 for which there is currently no m known making k + 2^m a prime or probable prime. - _T. D.
