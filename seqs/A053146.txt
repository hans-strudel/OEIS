%N A053146 When cototient function (A051953) is iterated with initial value A002110(n), a(n) = number of iterates that are not powers of 2.
%C A053146 In these iteration chains the number of non-2-powers seem to be in majority.
%e A053146 n=6, A002110(6)=30030; the corresponding iteration chain is: {30030,24270,17806,9238,4798,2400,1760,1120,736,384,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1,0}. It has 20 terms, among which entries from the first to 10th, also the last 0, are not powers of 2, so a(6)=11.
%Y A053146 A002110, A051953.
