%N A002831 Number of 3-edge-colored connected trivalent graphs with 2n nodes.
%C A002831 In a letter to N. J. A. Sloane dated Feb 04 1971 (see link), R. C. Read enclosed a table listing 14 sequences, all of which, he says, appeared in his 1958 Ph. D. thesis. The values he gave for terms a(5) and a(6) in the present sequence are apparently incorrect (the terms given here are correct; the incorrect terms are shown in A246598). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 08 2014
%C A002831 Comment from _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 09 2014: the relationship between "all graphs" and "connected graphs" is of course a version of the Euler transform - see for example the third formula in the Euler Transform link.
