%N A034997 Number of Generalized Retarded Functions in Quantum Field Theory.
%C A034997 a(d) is the number of parts into which d-dimensional space (x_1,...,x_d) is split by a set of (2^d - 1) hyperplanes c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + ...+ c_d x_d =0 where c_j are 0 or +1 and we exclude the case with all c=0.
%C A034997 Also, a(d) is the number of independent real-time Green functions of Quantum Field Theory produced when analytically continuing from euclidean time/energy (d+1 = number of energy/time variables).  These are also known as Generalized Retarded Functions.
%C A034997 The numbers up to d=6 were first produced by T. S. Evans using a Pascal program, strictly as upper bounds only.  M. van Eijck wrote a C program using a direct enumeration of hyperplanes which confirmed these and produced the value for d=7. Kamiya et al. showed how to find these numbers and some associated polynomials using more sophisticated methods, giving results up to d=7. T. S. Evans added the last number on Aug 01 2011 using an updated version of van Eijck's program, which took 7 days on a standard desktop computer.

%e A034997 a(1)=2 because the point x=0 splits the real line into two parts, the positive and negative reals.
%e A034997 a(2)=6 because we can split two dimensional space into 6 parts using lines x=0, y=0 and x+y=0.
