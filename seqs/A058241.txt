%N A058241 For i=1 to n, c(i) is a positive integer such that c(x) != c(y) if x != y; place each c(i) on the circumference of a circle at regular intervals. The arrangement must be such that any sum of adjacent c(i)'s is unique (these sums range from 1 to n(n-1)+1); a(n) = number of ways to choose the c(i).
%C A058241 a(1)=1, a(2)=1; conjecture: for n>2, p prime, e>0, if n-1 is of the form p^e then a(n)>0 else a(n)=0.

%e A058241 For n=3: we can choose 1 for c(1), 4 for c(2), 2 for c(3). We place the three numbers on the circumference: any sum of adjacent c(i) along the circumference is unique. We can see the numbers from 1 to 3*(3-1)+1. { 1=1, 2= 2, 3=1+2, 4=4, 5=1+4, 6=2+4, 7=1+2+4=3*(3-1)+1 .; The set of c(i) which agrees with the arrangement condition is unique so a(3) = 1.
