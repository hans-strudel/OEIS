%N A036383 First differences of odd split numbers (A036382).
%C A036383 The large local maxima are near powers of 2. Compare the differences of connected numbers (A036379).
%C A036383 Densities of connected (A029827) and split (A036382) numbers seem to behave in opposite way: where connected are dense, split ones are rare and vice versa.
%e A036383 177,183,189,195,203,217,259,261 are successive odd split numbers. So their difference sequence is 6,6,6,8,14,42 and 2.
%Y A036383 Cf. A029837, A036378-A036390.
