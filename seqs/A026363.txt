%C A026363 Or, starting from the natural number, delete successively from the working sequence the term in position 2*a(n). From natural numbers, delete the term in position 2*1, i.e., 2. This leaves 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,... . Delete now the term in position 2*3=6, i.e., 7. This leaves 1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,... . Delete now the term in position 2*4=8, i.e., 10. This leaves 1,3,4,5,6,8,9,11,... and so on. - Philippe Lallouet (philip.lallouet(AT)wanadoo.fr), Aug 20 2007
%C A026363 The term deleted from the n-th working sequence is equal to A026364(n), which means that all integers which are not in the present sequence are in A026364 and no others. - Philippe Lallouet (philip.lallouet(AT)orange.fr), May 05 2008
