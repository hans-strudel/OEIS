%N A057635 a(n) is the largest m such that phi(m)=n, where phi is Euler's Totient function.
%C A057635 To check that a property P holds for all EulerPhi(x) not exceeding n, for n with a(n) > 0, it suffices to check P for all EulerPhi(x) with x not exceeding a(n). - _Joseph L. Pe_, Jan 10 2002
%C A057635 The Alekseyev link in A131883 establishes the following explicit relationship between A131883, A036912 and A057635. Namely, for t belonging to A036912, we have t=A131883(A057635(t)-1). In other words, A036912(n) = A131883(A057635(A036912(n))-1) for all n.
