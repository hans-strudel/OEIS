%N A049298 Take reduced residue systems of n, generate its first differences, dRRS(n); sequence gives maximal value of dRSSS(n).
%C A049298 Greatest values occur at primorial numbers (A002110).
%e A049298 If n is prime, its reduced residue system consists of all numbers below n. But the difference 2 arises from d=1-(n-1)=-n+2 (mod n).
%Y A049298 Cf. A048670. Essentially same as A048669.
%K A049298 nonn
%O A049298 1,3
%A A049298 _Labos Elemer_
