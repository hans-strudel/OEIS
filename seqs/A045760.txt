%N A045760 Smallest Maris-McGwire k-tuple (k>1) for each k: f(n) = f(n+1) = ... = f(n+k-1), where f is defined in comments.
%C A045760 A045759 generalizes to k consecutive integers that all have the same value of f(n), where f(n) = sum of digits of n plus sum of digits in prime factors of n. The sequence shows the integer which starts the smallest set of k (and no more than k) consecutive integers having this property.
