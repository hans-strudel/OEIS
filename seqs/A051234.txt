%N A051234 Possible orders of central factor groups of groups.
%C A051234 Contains all even n >= 2, no primes, all prime powers p^n, for n>1. Other entries are complicated and follow from certain congruences.
%D A051234 Commutativity and Generalizations in Finite Groups, Aine NiShe, Ph.D.thesis in preparation.
%e A051234 a(1)=1,since |G/Z(G)|=1 for all Abelian groups G; a(2)=4,since |Q/Z(Q)|=4 where Q is the quaternion group of order eight.
