%N A019569 Number of bar segments in a certain way of representing the integers graphically.
%C A019569 Let p(i) = i-th prime. Let n = Product_{i=1..s} p(k_i)^e_i with k_1 < k_2 < ... < k_s. The drawing of n=1 is a blank space. The drawing of n > 1 is arranged around a horizontal bar divided by s-1 scores into s segments. The scores and the bar divide the space above and below the bar into 2's compartments. In the i-th compartment above the bar place the drawing of e_i and in the i-th compartment below the bar place the drawing of k_i - k_{i-1}.
