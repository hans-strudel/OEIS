%N A061059 Write product of first n primes as x*y with x<y and x maximal; sequence gives value of y.
%C A061059 Is this the same as A060796? [From _R. J. Mathar_, Oct 02 2008]
%C A061059 Yes: primorial(n) = A002110(n) = Pn# is never a square, it has N=2^n distinct divisors. This is an even number, and the N divisors can be grouped in pairs d(k), d(N+1-k) with product equal to Pn#, and one being smaller and one being larger than sqrt(Pn#). This sequence gives the (2^(n-1)+1)-th divisor, which is the smallest one larger than sqrt(Pn#). - M. F. Hasler, Sep 20 2011
