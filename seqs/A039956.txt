%N A039956 Even squarefree numbers.
%C A039956 Sum of even divisors = 2* the sum of odd divisors. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Sep 07 2002
%C A039956 From _Daniel Forgues_, May 27 2009: (Start)
%C A039956 a(n) = n * (3/1) * zeta(2) + O(n^(1/2)) = n * (3/1) * (pi^2 / 6) + O(n^(1/2)).
%C A039956 For any prime p_i, the n-th squarefree number even to p_i (divisible by p_i) is:
%C A039956 n * ((p_i + 1)/1) * zeta(2) + O(n^(1/2)) = n * (p_i + 1)/1) * (pi^2 / 6) + O(n^(1/2)).
%C A039956 For any prime p_i, there are as many squarefree numbers having p_i as a factor as squarefree numbers not having p_i as a factor amongst all the squarefree numbers (one-to-one correspondence, both cardinality aleph_0).
%C A039956 E.g., there are as many even squarefree numbers as there are odd squarefree numbers.
%C A039956 For any prime p_i, the density of squarefree numbers having p_i as a factor is 1/p_i of the density of squarefree numbers not having p_i as a factor.
%C A039956 E.g., the density of even squarefree numbers is 1/p_i = 1/2 of the density of odd squarefree numbers (which means that 1/(p_i + 1) = 1/3 of the squarefree numbers are even and p_i/(p_i + 1) = 2/3 are odd) and as a consequence the n-th even squarefree number is very nearly p_i = 2 times the n-th odd squarefree number (which means that the n-th even squarefree number is very nearly (p_i + 1) = 3 times the n-th squarefree number while the n-th odd squarefree number is very nearly (p_i + 1)/ p_i = 3/2 the n-th squarefree number).
%C A039956 (End)
%C A039956 Sum_{n>=1} a(n)/n^s = zeta(s)/((1+2^s)*zeta(2*s)). - _Enrique PÃ©rez Herrero_, Sep 15 2012
