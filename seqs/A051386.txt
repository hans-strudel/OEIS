%N A051386 Numbers whose 4th power is the sum of two positive cubes.
%C A051386 n such that n^4 = r^3 + s^3 has a solution with r>0, s>0.
%C A051386 By multiplying n^4 = r^3 + s^3 by n^3, also numbers whose 7th power is expressible as the sum of positive cubes.
%C A051386 When n is the sum of 2 positive cubes (A003325) there is a trivial solution: e.g., 133 is a term in A003325, 133=2^3+5^3 and 133^4=(2*133)^3+(5*133)^3. - _Moshe Levin_, Oct 17 2011
%C A051386 From _Robert Israel_, Jun 01 2015: (Start)
%C A051386 Slightly more generally, if x^3 + y^3 = u*v^4, then (u*v*w^3)^4 = (u*w^4*x)^3 + (u*w^4*y)^3, so u*v*w^3 is in the sequence for any w >= 1.
%C A051386 There are at least five pairs of adjacent numbers in the sequence: (133,134),(182,183), (854,855), (1842,1843), (3473,3474).  Are there infinitely many?
