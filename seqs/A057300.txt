%N A057300 Binary counter with odd/even bit positions swapped; base 4 counter with 1's replaced by 2's and vice versa.
%C A057300 A self-inverse permutation of the integers.
%C A057300 It is not true in general that a(2n) = -2a(n) + 5n, a(2n+1) = -2a(n) + 5n + 2 as was originally conjectured.
%C A057300 Counterexamples: a(46) = 29; a(92) = 172; binary(172) = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], but binary(-2*29+5*92) = binary(402) = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. a(45) = 30; a(91) = 167; binary(167) = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], but -2*30+5*91+2=397 and binary(397) = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]. - Lambert Herrgesell (zero815(AT)googlemail.com), Jan 13 2007
%C A057300 a(n) = n if and only if n can be written as 3*Sum[d_i*4^k, 0 <= k < infinity], where d_i is either 0 or 1. - _Jon Perry_, Oct 06 2012
%C A057300 From _Veselin Jungic_, Mar 03 2015: (Start)
%C A057300 In 1988 A. F. Sidorenko, see the Sidorenko reference, used this sequence as an example of a permutation of the set of positive integers with the property that if positive integers i, j, and k form a 3-term arithmetic progression then the corresponding terms a(i), a(j), and a(k) do not form an arithmetic progression.
%C A057300 In the terminology introduced in the Brown, Jungic, and Poelstra reference, the sequence does not contain "double 3-term arithmetic progressions".
%C A057300 It is not difficult to check that this sequence is with unbounded gaps, i.e., for any positive number m there is a natural number n such that a(n+1)-a(n) > m.
%C A057300 It is an open question if every sequence of integers with bounded gaps must contain a double 3-term arithmetic progression. This problem is equivalent to the well known additive square problem in infinite words: Is it true that any infinite word with a finite set of integers as its alphabet contains two consecutive blocks of the same length and the same sum? For more details about the additive square problem in infinite words see the following references: Ardal, et al.; Brown and Freedman; Freedman; Grytczuk; Halbeisen and Hungerbuhler, and Pirillo and Varricchio.
%C A057300 The sequence was attributed to Sidorenko in P. Hegarty's paper "Permutations avoiding arithmetic patterns". In his paper Hegarty characterized the countably infinite abelian groups for which there exists a bijection mapping arithmetic progressions to non-arithmetic progressions. This was further generalized by Jungic and Sahasrabudhe. (End)
