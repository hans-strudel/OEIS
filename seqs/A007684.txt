%N A007684 Prime(n)*...*prime(a(n)) is the least product of consecutive primes that is non-deficient.
%C A007684 Subscript of the smallest primorial number that when divided by the (n-1)-th primorial number gives an abundant number.
%C A007684 Products of consecutive primes started with p(a) up to p(b) result in abundant squarefree numbers if b is large enough and provides perhaps the least squarefree solutions to Rivera Puzzle 329 and its generalization.
%H A007684 C. Rivera, <a href="http://www.primepuzzles.net/puzzles/puzz_329.htm">Puzzle 329. Odd abundant numbers not divided by 2 or 3.</a>
%F A007684 a(n) is the solution to Min{x : Floor[sigma(p#(x)/p#(n-1))/(p#(x)/p#(n-1))=2]}, where p#(w) is the w-th primorial number, the product of first w prime numbers. For a>b, the p#(a)/p#(b)=A000210(a)/A000210(b) quotients are p(b+1)*p(b+2)...p(a) where p(j) is the j-th prime number.
%e A007684 n=1: a(1)=2 means that primorial(2)=6 divided by primorial(1-1)=1 gives the quotient 6/1=6 which is just abundant (being a perfect number);
%e A007684 n=3: a(n)=11 because p(3)=5 primorial(11) = 2*3*5*...*29*31, primorial(3-1) = 2*3 = 6.
%e A007684 p#(11)/p#(2) = 3*5*7*11*13*17*19*23*29*31 = 33426748355 = q and sigma(q)/q = 2.00097 >2 so q is an abundant number. Also p#(10)/p#(3-1) is not yet abundant.
%t A007684 spr[x_, y_] :=Apply[Times, Table[(Prime[w]+1)/(Prime[w]), {w, x, y}]] Table[Min[Flatten[Position[Table[Floor[spr[n, w]], {w, 1, 1000}], 2]]], {n, 1, 20}] (* _Labos Elemer_, Sep 19 2005 *)
