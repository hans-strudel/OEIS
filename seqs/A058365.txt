%N A058365 Number of ways to cover (without overlapping) a ring lattice (necklace) of n sites with molecules that are 8 sites wide.
%C A058365 This comment covers a family of sequences which satisfy a recurrence of the form a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-m), with a(n) = 1 for n = 1...m-1, a(m) = m+1. The generating function is (x+m*x^m)/(1-x-x^m). Also a(n) = 1 + n*sum(binomial(n-1-(m-1)*i, i-1)/i, i=1..n/m). This gives the number of ways to cover (without overlapping) a ring lattice (or necklace) of n sites with molecules that are m sites wide. Special cases: m=2: A000204, m=3: A001609, m=4: A014097, m=5: A058368, m=6: A058367, m=7: A058366, m=8: A058365, m=9: A058364.

%F A058365 a(n) = 1 + n*sum(binomial(n-1-7*i, i-1)/i, i=1..n/8). a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-8), a(n) = 1 for n = 1..7, a(8) = 9. generating function = (x+8*x^8)/(1-x-x^8).
%e A058365 a(8) = 9 because there is one way to put zero molecule to the necklace and 8 ways to put one molecule.
