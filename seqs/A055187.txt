%N A055187 Cumulative counting sequence: method A (adjective-before-noun)-pairs with first term 1.
%C A055187 Conjectures: limit as n goes to infinity of max {a(k) : 1<=k<=n}/sqrt(n) = 2;
%C A055187 -3 < a(n) - 2*sqrt(n) < 3 for all n;
%C A055187 there are infinitely many n such that a(n)=a(n+1). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Jan 30 2003
%C A055187 After starting with 1, successive segments are generated in adjective-before-noun pairs as in A055186 (i.e., the noun-integers are in increasing order).  See A217780 for the sequence originally placed here, in which the noun-integers are in order of 1st occurrence. - _Clark Kimberling_, Mar 24 2013
