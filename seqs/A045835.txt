%N A045835 Numbers n such that sopfr(Omega(n)) = Omega(sopfr(n)), where Omega(m) is the number and sopfr(m) is the sum of prime factors of m, with repetition respectively.
%C A045835 A001414(A001222(a(n))) = A001222(A001414(a(n)));
%C A045835 squares of primes (A001248) are a subsequence.
%e A045835 n=189=3*3*3*7: Omega(soprf(189)=Omega(3+3+3+7)=Omega(16)=4, sopfr(Omega(189))=soprf(4)=2+2=4, therefore 189 is a term.
%Y A045835 Cf. A076361.
%K A045835 nonn
%O A045835 1,2
