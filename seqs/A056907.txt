%N A056907 Numbers n where 36n^2+12n+5 is prime (sorted by absolute values with negatives before positives).
%C A056907 36m^2+12m+5=(6m+1)^2+4 which is four more than a square. Except for a(0), a(n) is never a multiple of 5.
%e A056907 a(3)=2 since 36*2^2+12*2+5=173 which is prime (as well as being four more than a square)
%Y A056907 This sequence and formula, together with A056908 and its formula, generate all primes of the form k^2+4, i.e. A005473. Except for the first term, this sequence is a subsequence of A047201. Cf. A056900, A056902, A056904, A056906.
