%N A020755 Increasing gaps between squarefree numbers (upper end).
%C A020755 Up to n=10, a(n) is the upper end of the first gap of length n. However, for n=11 through n=16, a(n) is the upper end of the first gap of length n+1. See A020753. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 28 2015
%F A020755 a(n) = A020754(n) + A020753(n). - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 28 2015
%e A020755 The first gap in A005117 occurs between 1 and 2 and has length 1. The next largest gap occurs between 3 and 5 and has length 2. The next largest gap is between 7 and 10 and has length 3. Etc. We are only interested in gaps that set new records.
