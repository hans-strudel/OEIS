%N A049225 Values of totient function applied to squarefree numbers; or numbers of form Product (p_i-1) where p_i are distinct primes.
%F A049225 Numbers n such that n = phi(k) and |mu(k)| = 1.
%e A049225 8,120,48 are here as totient functions of squarefree numbers 15, 143, 210. 54 and 110, 294, 342 are missing since there are no squarefree k such that phi(k) = 54, 110, etc.
%Y A049225 Terms of A049200 after ordering and omitting multiple occurrences.
%Y A049225 Cf. A000010, A005117, A013929, A002174, A002202, A049200.
