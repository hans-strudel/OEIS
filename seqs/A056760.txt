%N A056760 Integers with exactly 2 prime divisors such that the cube of the number of divisors exceeds the number.
%C A056760 Numbers with 8 prime divisors also occur among cases satisfying relation d^3>n.
%C A056760 Prime divisors are counted without multiplicity. [From Harvey P. Dale, May 14 2012]

%F A056760 d[n]^3 > n, n=(p^w)*(q^u), d[]=A000005()
%e A056760 The sequence is finite and almost surely complete. Between 270000 and 17000000 no more cases were found. The last 3 entries are: 165888,186624,248832. E.g. n=1024*343=248832, with 66 divisors and d^3=287496>248832
