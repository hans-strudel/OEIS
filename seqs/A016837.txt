%N A016837 Primes reached after k iterations of sum of n and its prime divisors = t (where t replaces n in each iteration).
%C A016837 Patrick asked what composite would produce 666 or 313 iterations. Carlos has also been working on the problem and asks if there is a run of 3 primes produced by consecutive composites. So original idea belongs to Patrick. This sequence was calculated by Enoch.

%F A016837 Factor n, add n and its prime divisors. Sum = t, t replaces n, repeat until a prime is produced.
%e A016837 Starting from 4, 4=2*2, so 4+2+2=8. 8=2*2*2 so 8+2+2+2=14. 14=2*7 so 14+2+7=23, prime is 23 in 3 iterations.
