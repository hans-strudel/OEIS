%N A047531 Numbers that are congruent to {2, 3, 7} mod 8.
%C A047531 From _Richard R. Forberg_, Mar 14 2016 : (Start)
%C A047531 Numbers m such that p^2 + q^2 + r^2 - m is a square, for distinct odd primes p, q, and r. This follows from the fact that the sum of the squares of three odd primes is 3 mod 8, and squares are {0,1,4} mod 8. Changing -m to +m leads to A047438.
%C A047531 The expression p^2 + q^2 + r^2 - m can equal the square of an odd number only when m == 2 mod 8 (because all odd squares are 1 mod 8).
%C A047531 This same expression only equals squares of primes for m in {2, 10, 26, 34} mod 48, because when m = {18, 42} mod 48, the expression is congruent to {9, 33} mod 48, which matches the values of (6*k-3)^2 mod 48.
