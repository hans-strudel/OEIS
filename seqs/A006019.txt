%N A006019 Remoteness number of n in Simon Norton's game of Tribulations.
%C A006019 The game of Tribulations is similar to Epstein's game in A005240, but the number of chips to be put or taken is the largest triangular number not larger than C: C-> C +- A057944(C). The remoteness is the number of moves in the game if the initial heap has n chips and both players play the optimum strategy. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 06 2016

%e A006019 For all positive triangular numbers (A000217) the remoteness is 1, because the starting player uses the strategy to take all of the chips and the game is over. The remoteness of 2 is 2, because taking one or putting one in the first move leads anyway to a n with remoteness 1. The remoteness of 4 is 6: 4 -> 7 -> 13 ->23 -> 2 -> (1 or 3) -> 0. - _R. J.
