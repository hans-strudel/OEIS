%N A010928 Binomial coefficient C(12,n).
%C A010928 Row 12 of A007318.
%C A010928 Also number of positions that are exactly n moves from the starting position in the Orbix Type 1 puzzle. This is the number of positions that can be reached in n moves from the start, but which cannot be reached in fewer than n moves. A puzzle in the Rubik cube family. The total number of distinct positions is 4096. Here positions differing by rotations or reflections are considered distinct.
%C A010928 If the sequence is extended by trailing zeros, its binomial transform yields A010965. - _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 19 2008
