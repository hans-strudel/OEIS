%N A062590 Variation on A029834: a discrete version of the Mangoldt function. If n is prime then floor(log(prime(n)) else 0.
%F A062590 a(n) = delta(tau(n), 2) * floor(log(prime(n)) = A010051(n) * A029835(n), where delta is the Kronecker delta function and tau is the number of divisors function. - _Alonso del Arte_, Sep 11 2013
%e A062590 a(5) = 2 because the fifth prime is 11, the logarithm of which is 2.397895...
%e A062590 a(6) = 0 because 6 is not prime.
%e A062590 a(7) = 2 because the seventh prime is 17, the logarithm of which is 2.833213344...
