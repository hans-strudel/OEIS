%N A019589 Number of nondecreasing sequences that are differences of two permutations of 1,2,...,n.
%C A019589 From _Olivier Gérard_, Sep 18 2007: (Start)
%C A019589 Number of classes of permutations arrays giving the same partition by the following transformation (equivalent in this case to X-rays but more general): on the matrix representation of a permutation of order n, the sum (i.e., here, number of ones) in the i-th antidiagonal is the number of copies of i in the partition.
%C A019589 This gives an injection of permutations of n into partitions with parts at most 2n-1. The first or the last antidiagonal can be omitted, reducing the size of parts to 2n-2 without changing the number of classes.
%C A019589 This sequence is called Lambda_{n,1} in Louck's paper and appears explicitly on p. 758. Terms up to 10 were computed by Myron Stein (arXiv).
%C A019589 This is similar to the number of Schur functions studied by Di Francesco et al. (A007747) related to the powers of the Vandermonde determinant. Also number of classes of straight (monotonic) crossing bi-permutations. (End)
