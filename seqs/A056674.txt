%N A056674 Number of squarefree divisors which are not unitary. Also number of unitary divisors which are not squarefree.
%C A056674 Numbers of unitary and of squarefree divisors are identical, although the 2 sets are usually different, so sizes of parts outside overlap are also equal to each other.
%F A056674 a(n)=A034444(n)-A000005[A055231(n)] a(n)=A034444(n)-A000005[A007913(n)/A055229(n)]
%e A056674 n=252, it has 18 divisors, 8 are unitary, 8 are squarefree, 2 belong to both classes, so 6 are squarefree but not unitary, thus a(252)=6. Set {2,3,14,21,42} forms squarefree but non-unitary while set {4,9,36,28,63,252} of same size gives the set of not squarefree but unitary divisors.
