%N A049008 Greatest possible number of right angles that can occur as interior angles in a planar n-gon.
%C A049008 Reflex angles (e.g. 270 degrees) are not considered right angles. From a(6) on, this duplicates A004396 from its eighth term.
%F A049008 a(3) = 1; a(4) = 4; a(5) = 3; a(3*k+3) = 2*k+3; a(3*k+4) = 2*k+3; a(3*k+5) = 2*k+4 where k starts from 1 OR a(n) is the greatest integer less than 2/3*(n+2) where n starts from 6.
%e A049008 a(3) = 1 because you can only have one right angle in a triangle; a(4) = 4 as in a rectangular quadrilateral; a(100) = 67 etc.
%Y A049008 Cf. A004396.
%K A049008 easy,nonn
%O A049008 3,2
