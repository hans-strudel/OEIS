%N A062165 Number of ways of placing n nonattacking (normal) queens on n X n board, solutions similar on the torus count only once.
%C A062165 Two n-queens solutions p and q are considered similar iff there is a factor f, 0 < f < n, satisfying gcd (f,n) = 1, such that for all k from {0, ..., n-1} q (k * f mod n) = p (k) * f mod n or q is a rotation, a reflection or a shift of such a q. In other words, also expansions are allowed which move the queen at (k, p(k)) to (f * k mod n, f * p(k) mod n).
%C A062165 The sequence reduces exactly the objects of A062164 and, via that sequence, these of A002562 and A000170. Note that the equivalence classes of this sequence are a subset of A062168.
