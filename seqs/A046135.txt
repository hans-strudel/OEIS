%C A046135 From _Jonathan Vos Post_, May 17 2006: (Start)
%C A046135 Could be defined as "Numbers n such that k^3+k^2+n is prime for k = 0, 1, 2."
%C A046135 The following subset is also prime for k = 3: 5, 11, 17, 71, 101, 137, 227, 281, 347, 431, 641, 827, 1151, 1277, 1487.  The following subset of those is also prime for k = 4: 17, 71, 101, 227, 827, 1151, 1487.  The following subset of those is also prime for k = 5: 827, 1151, 1487.  The "17" in A050266's n^3+n^2+17 is because k^3+k^2+17 is prime for k = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Between 10000 and 20000 there are 30 members of the k = 0,1,2 sequence, of which these 10 are also prime for k = 3: 10301, 10937, 11057, 11777, 12107, 13997, 15137, 15737, 16061, 19541.  The following subset of those is also prime for k = 5: 15137, 15737, 16061.  Somewhere in these sequences is a value that breaks the 11-term record of A050266 and indeed any known prime generating polynomial record. (End)
