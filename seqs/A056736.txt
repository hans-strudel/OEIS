%N A056736 Numbers n such that 2^n in base 3 has same number of 2's as 2^(n+1) in base 3 and 2^n and 2^(n+1) have the same number of digits in base 3.
%C A056736 Using empirical data for 1 <= n <= 10000, it has been found that the distribution of these terms correlates well (R^2 = 0.9936) to h(n) = c*n^(1/2) with 'c' a constant approximately 0.64. In addition, h'(n) approximates the probability that any particular n has this property. Any terms in sequence A056154 must also satisfy this sequence.
%e A056736 First term: 2^5 = 1012, 2^6 = 2101, both with 1 two and both of length 4. Second term: 2^16 = 10022220021, 2^17 = 20122210112, both with 5 twos and both of length 11.
