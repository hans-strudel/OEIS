%N A060750 Step at which card n appears on top of deck for first time in Guy's shuffling problem A035485.
%C A060750 Card #1 is initially at the top of the deck and next appears at the top of the deck after 3 shuffles. Here we do not accept 0 as a valid number of shuffles and so we say that card #1 first shows up on top after 3 shuffles. A060751 and A060752 also adopt this convention. Alternatively, we can say that card #1 first shows up on top after 0 shuffles; this leads to sequences A035490, A057983, A057984, etc.
%D A060750 See A035490 for references, links and programs.
%Y A060750 Cf. A035485, A035490-A035494, A060751, A060752.
