%N A006064 Smallest junction number with n generators.
%C A006064 Strictly speaking, a junction number is a number n with more than one solution to x+digitsum(x) = n. However, it seems best to start this sequence with n=0, for which there is just one solution, x=0. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 31 2013.
%C A006064 a(3) = 10^13 + 1 was found by Narasinga Rao, who reports that Kaprekar verified that it is the smallest term. No details of Kaprekar's proof were given.
%C A006064 a(4) = 10^24 + 102 was conjectured by Narasinga Rao.
%C A006064 a(5) = 10^1111111111124 + 102. - Conjectured by Narasinga Rao, confirmed by _Max Alekseyev_ and _N. J. A. Sloane_.
%C A006064 a(6) = 10^2222222222224 + 10000000000002. - _Max Alekseyev_
%C A006064 a(7) = 10^( (10^24 + 10^13 + 115) / 9 ) + 10^13 + 2. - _Max Alekseyev_
%C A006064 a(8) = 10^( (2*10^24 + 214)/9 ) + 10^24 + 103. - _Max Alekseyev_

%F A006064 a(n) = the smallest m such that there are exactly n solutions to A062028(x)=m.
%e A006064 a(2) = 101 since 101 is the smallest number with two generators: 101 = A062028(91) = A062028(100).
%e A006064 a(4) = 10^24 + 102 = 1000000000000000000000102 exactly exactly four inverses w.r.t. A062028, namely 999999999999999999999893, 999999999999999999999902, 1000000000000000000000091 and 1000000000000000000000100.
%Y A006064 Cf. A003052, A230093, A230100, A230303, A230857 (highest power of 10).
%Y A006064 Smallest number m such that u + (sum of base-b digits of u) = m has exactly n solutions, for bases 2 through 10: A230303, A230640, A230638, A230867, A238840, A238841, A238842, A238843, A006064.
