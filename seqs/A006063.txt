%N A006063 A card-arranging problem: values of n such that there exists a permutation p_1, ..., p_n of 1, ..., n such that i + p_i is a cube for every i.
%C A006063 Apparently Gardner (1975) quotes Papaikonomou as showing that there can be at most one solution for a given n. However, this is incorrect: see A096680 for n values with more than one such permutation. (Ray Chandler)
%C A006063 For any n, the number of permutations is permanent(m), where the n-by-n matrix m is defined m(i,j) = 1 or 0, depending on whether i+j is a cube or not. Hence, n is in this sequence if permanent(m) > 0.
