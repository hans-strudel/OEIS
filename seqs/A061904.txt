%N A061904 Numbers n such that the iterative cycle: n -> sum of digits of n^2 has only one distinct element.
%C A061904 Since the only numbers invariant under this iteration are 1 and 9, n is contained in this sequence iff the sum of digits of n^2 is 1 or 9.
%e A061904 6 -> 3+6 = 9 -> 8+1 = 9 thus 9 is the only element of the iterative cycle of 6. 12 -> 1+4+4 = 9 -> 8+1 = 9 ...
%Y A061904 Cf. A007953, A004159, A061903 - A061910.
