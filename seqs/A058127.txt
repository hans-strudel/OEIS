%N A058127 Triangle read by rows: T(j,k) = number of acyclic functions from {1,...,j} to {1,...,k}. For n >= 1, a(n)=(k-j)*k^(j-1), where k is such that C(k,2) < n <= C(k+1,2) and j=(n-1)mod[C(k,2)]. Alternatively, table T(k,j) read by antidiagonals with k >= 1, 0<=j<=k: T(k,j)=number of acyclic-function digraphs on k vertices with j vertices of outdegree 1 and (k-j) vertices of outdegree 0; T(k,j)=(k-j)*k^(j-1).
%C A058127 An acyclic function f from domain D={1,...,j} to codomain C={1,...,k} is a function such that, for every subset A of D, f(A) does not equal A. Equivalently, an acyclic function f "eventually sends" under successive composition all elements of D to {j+1,...,k}. An acyclic-function digraph G is a labeled directed graph that satisfies (i) all vertices have outdegree 0 or 1; (ii) if vertex x has outdegree 0 and vertex y has outdegree 1, then x > y; (iii) G has no cycles and no loops. There is a one-to-one correspondence between acyclic functions from D to C and acyclic-function digraphs with j vertices of outdegree 1 and j-k vertices of outdegree 0.
%C A058127 n-th row of the triangle is the n-th iterate of "perform binomial transform operation" (bto) on current row to get next row, extracting the leftmost n terms for n-th row. (i.e. all terms left of the zero). First row is (bto): [1, -1, 0, 0, 0...]. 5th row is 1, 4, 15, 50, 125, since (bto) performed 5 times iteratively on [1, -1, 0, 0, 0...] = 1, 4, 15, 50, 125, 0, -31... - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 30 2005

%F A058127 For fixed m=k-j, a(n)=T(k, j)=T(m+j, j)=m*(m+j)^(j-1). Exponential generating function g for T(m+j, j)=m*(m+j)^(j-1) is given by g(t)= exp(-m*W(-t)), where W denotes the principal branch of Lambert's W function. Lambert's W function satisfies W(t)*exp(W(t))=t for t>=-exp(-1).
%e A058127 a(6)=T(3,2)=3 because there are 3 acyclic functions from {1,2} to {1,2,3}: {(1,2),(2,3)}, {(1,3),(2,3)} and {(1,3),(2,1)}.

%Y A058127 The sum of antidiagonals is A058128. The sequence b(n)=T(n, n-1) for n >= 1 is A000272, labeled trees on n nodes.
%Y A058127 The sequence c(n)=T(n, n-2) for n >= 2 is A089104(n). The sequence d(n)=T(n, n-3) for n >= 3 is A089463(n-3,0). [_Peter Luschny_, Apr 22 2009]
