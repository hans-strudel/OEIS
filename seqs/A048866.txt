%N A048866 Difference between number of nonprimes and primes in reduced residue system of n.
%e A048866 n = 31: Phi(31) = 30 from which 10 is prime and 20 is not: a(31) = 20-10 = 10; n = 20: Phi(20) = 8 from which 6 are primes and 2 are not: a(20) = 2-6 = -4; n = 15: reduced residue system = {1,2,7,4,8,11,13,14}, primes = {2,7,11,13,}, nonprimes = {2,4,8,14}, thus a(15) = 4-4 = 0.
