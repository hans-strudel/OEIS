%N A062505 If p = prime divides n, then either p+2 or p-2 is prime.
%C A062505 Multiplicative closure of twin primes (A001097).
%e A062505 35 is included because 35 = 5*7 and both (5+2) and (7-2) are primes.
%e A062505 65=5*13 where the factors are members of twin prime pairs: (3,5) and (11,13), therefore a(29)=65 is a term; but 69 is not because 69=3*23 and 23=A007510(2) is a single prime.
