%N A035092 Smallest k - dependent on n - such that (n^2)*k+1 is prime where k is the subscript of the progressions.
%C A035092 This is one possible generalization of "the least prime problem" for nk+1 arithmetic progression when n is replaced by n^2, a special difference.
%H A035092 <a href="/index/Pri#primes_AP">Index entries for sequences related to primes in arithmetic progressions</a>
%e A035092 a(40) = 1 because in 1600k + 1 at k = 1, 1601 is the smallest prime; a(61)=46 because in 46*46*k+1 sequence the first prime appears at k=46, it is 171167.
