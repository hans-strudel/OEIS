%N A049486 Maximum length of non-crossing path on n X n square lattice.
%C A049486 One can re-use a point, but not an edge.
%C A049486 The n X n square has #(n) = 2n(n+1) line segments and v_o(n) = 4(n-1) vertices of odd degree. The network is traversable only when v_o(n) <= 2. When not, we must lose sufficient line segments to reduce v_o() to 2. (cont.)
%C A049486 For odd n >= 3, we have an even number of odd vertices along each edge; we can pair them up and lose the single line segment joining each pair except for our start/end points. So in this case we have a(n) = #(n) - (v_o(n) - 2)/2 = 2n^2 + 3. (cont.)
%C A049486 For even n >= 2, we have an odd number of odd vertices along each edge. The best we can do is start and end at the two vertices adjacent to one corner; pairing up the rest allows us to lose a single line segment for each of the remaining pairs except for the two vertices adjacent to the diagonally opposite corner, for which we must lose 2 line segments. So in this case we have a(n) = #(n) - ((v_o(n) - 4)/2 + 2) = 2n^2 + 2. (cont.)
%C A049486 For n < 2, we have no vertices of odd degree, so we cannot save a segment by starting and ending on a pair of them. So we can specify the exact function using a couple of characteristic functions: a(n) = 2n^2 + 1 + c(n > 1) + c(n odd) (I'm assuming a(0) = 1 here, on the grounds that there is a single zero-length path in that case.) (cont.)
%C A049486 Note that the theoretical maximum is always achievable, e.g. using Fleury's algorithm. - _Hugo van der Sanden_, Sep 27 2005
