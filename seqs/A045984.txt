%N A045984 a(n) = smallest number m such that factorizations of n consecutive integers starting at m have same number of primes (counted with multiplicity).
%C A045984 a(16) > 10^13. a(16) must have at least 5 prime factors (counted with multiplicity) because one of the 16 consecutive numbers is divisible by 2^4. - _Donovan Johnson_, Apr 01 2013
