%N A054581 Number of unlabeled 2-trees with n nodes.
%C A054581 A 2-tree is recursively defined as follows: K_2 is a 2-tree and any 2-tree on n+1 vertices is obtained by joining a vertex to a 2-clique in a 2-tree on n vertices. Care is needed with the term 2-tree (and k-tree in general) because it has at least two commonly used definitions.
%C A054581 A036361 gives the labeled version of this sequence, which has an easy formula analogous to Cayley's formula for the number of trees.
%C A054581 Also, number of unlabeled 3-gonal 2-trees with n 3-gons.

%e A054581 a(1)=a(2)=a(3)=1 because: K_2, K_3 are the only 2-trees on 2 and 3 nodes and on 4 nodes, there is a also unique example obtained by joining a triangle to K_3 along an edge (thus forming K_4\e). The two graphs on 5 nodes are obtained by joining a triangle to K_4\e, either along the shared edge or along one of the non-shared edges.
