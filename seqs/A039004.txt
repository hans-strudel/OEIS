%N A039004 Numbers n such that representation in base 4 has same number of 1's and 2's.

%C A039004 Conjecture: a(C(2n,n)-1) = 4^n - 1. (A000984 is C(2n,n). - _Gerald McGarvey_, Nov 18 2007
%C A039004 From _Russell Jay Hendel_, Jun 23 2015: (Start)
%C A039004 We prove the McGarvey conjecture (A) a(e(n,n)-1) = 4^n-1, with e(n,m) = a034870(n,m) = binomial(2n,m), the even rows of Pascal's triangle. By the comment from Hendel in A034870, we have the function s(n,k) = #{n-digit, base-4 numbers with n-k more 1-digits than 2-digits}. As shown in A034870, (B) #s(n,k)= e(n,k) with # indicating cardinality, that is, e(n,k) = binomial(2n,k) counts the number of n-digit, base-4 numbers with n-k more 1-digits than 2-digits.
%C A039004 We now show that (B) implies (A). By definition, s(n,n) contains the e(n,n) = binomial(2n,n) numbers with an equal number of 1-digits and 2-digits. The biggest n-digit, base-4 number is 333...3 (n copies of 3). Since 333...33 has zero 1-digits and zero 2-digits it follows that 333...333 is a member of s(n,n) and hence it is the biggest member of s(n,n). But 333...333 (n copies of 3) in base 4 has value 4^n-1. Since A039004 starts with index 0 (that is, 0 is the 0th member of A039004), it immediately follows that 4^n-1 is the (e(n,n)-1)st member of A039004, proving the McGarvey conjecture. (End)

%F A039004 Conjecture: there is a constant c around 5 such that a(n) is asymptotic to c*n. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Nov 24 2002
%F A039004 That conjecture is false. The number of members of the sequence from 0 to 4^d-1 is binomial(2d,d) which by Stirling's formula is asymptotic to 4^d/sqrt(Pi*d). If Cloitre's conjecture were true we would have 4^d-1 asymptotic to c*4^d/sqrt(Pi*d), a contradiction. - _Robert Israel_, Jun 24 2015
