%N A030077 Take n equally spaced points on circle, connect them by a path with n-1 line segments; sequence gives number of distinct path lengths under action of dihedral group.
%C A030077 For n points on a circle, there are floor(n/2) distinct line segment lengths. Hence an upper bound for a(n) is the number of compositions of n-1 into floor(n/2) parts, which is A099578(n-2). It appears that the upper bound is attained for prime n. To find a(n), the length of A052558(n-2) paths must be computed. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 09 2007
%e A030077 For n=4 the 3 lengths are: 3 boundary edges (length 3), edge-diagonal-edge (2 + sqrt 2) and diagonal-edge-diagonal (1 + 2sqrt 2). For n=5, the 4 edges of the path may include 0,...,4 diagonals, so a(5)=5.
%Y A030077 Cf. A007874 (similar, but with n line segments).
