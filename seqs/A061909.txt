%N A061909 Skinny numbers: numbers n such that there are no carries when n is squared by "long multiplication".
%C A061909 There are several equivalent formulations. Suppose the decimal expansion of n is n = Sum_{i = 0..k } d_i 10^i, where 0 <= d_i <= 9 for i = 0..k.
%C A061909 Then n is skinny if and only if:
%C A061909 (i) e_i = Sum_{ j = 0..i } d_j d_{i-j} <= 9 for i = 0 .. 2k-1;
%C A061909 (ii) if P_n(X) = Sum_{i = 0..k } d_i X^i (so P_n(10) = n) then P_{n^2}(X) = P_n(X)^2;
%C A061909 (iii) R(n^2) = R(n)^2, where R(n) means the digit reversal of n;
%C A061909 (iv) (sum of digits of n)^2 = sum of digits of n^2.
%C A061909 This entry is a merging and reworking of earlier entries from Asher Auel (asher.auel(AT)reed.edu), May 17 2001 and _Amarnath Murthy_, Aug 15 2005. Thanks to _Andrew Plewe_ for suggesting that these sequences might be identical.
%C A061909 Also, numbers n in base 10 whose base 10 expansion of n^2 is the same as if n were interpreted in some base b>10 and n^2 also calculated in that base. - Andrew Silberman (sandrew(AT)math.upenn.edu), Oct 30 2006

%F A061909 Further properties of skinny numbers, from _David Applegate_ and _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 14 2007: (Start)
%F A061909 The decimal expansion of a skinny number n may contain only 0's, 1's, 2's and 3's.
%F A061909 There may be at most one 3 and if there is a 3 then there can be no 2's. (Hence of course if there are any 2's then there can be no 3's.)
%F A061909 There is no limit to the number of 1's and 2's - consider for example Sum_{i=0..m} 10^{2^i} and 2*Sum_{i=0..m} 10^{2^i}.
%F A061909 These are necessary conditions, but are not sufficient (e.g., 131 is not skinny). (End)
%F A061909 Consequently a(n) >> n^2.0959..., where the exponent is log 10/log 3. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 21 2012
%e A061909 12 is a member as 12^2 =144, digit reversal of 144 is 441= 21^2.
%e A061909 13 is a member as 13 squared is 169 and sqrt(961) = 31.
%e A061909 113 is a member as 113^2 = 12769, reversal(12769) = 96721 = 311^2.
%e A061909 (Sum of digits of 13)^2 = 4^2 = 16 and sum of digits of 13^2 = sum of digits of 169 = 16.
%e A061909 10^k is in the sequence for all k >= 0, since reversal((10^k)^2) = 1 = (reversal(10^k))^2. - _Ryan Propper_, Sep 09 2005
