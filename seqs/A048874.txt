%N A048874 Almost-cubes: numbers n such that n/s(n) >= k/s(k) for all k<n, where s(m) is the least surface area of a rectangular parallelepiped with integer side lengths and volume m.

%e A048874 A rectangular parallelepiped with side lengths 1,2 and 3 has volume 6 and surface area 22. The ratio of volume to surface area is 6/22, which is greater than the ratio of volume to surface area for any rectangular parallelepiped with integer sides and volume < 6. Therefore 6 is an almost-cube.
