%N A054906 Smallest number x such that sigma(x+2n) = sigma(x)+2n (first definition).
%C A054906 Least (prime) solutions for phi(x+2n)=phi(x)+2n seems to be identical to this sequence, while prime solutions are indeed identical to this sequence.
%C A054906 2nd definition = smallest number x such that phi(x+2n)=phi(x)+2n.
%C A054906 3rd definition = smallest primes p such that p+2n=q prime (A020483).
%C A054906 The 3 definitions are identical or conjectured to be identical.
%C A054906 The definitions are not identical if we do not take the smallest numbers. These smallest solutions are believed to be always prime numbers.
%C A054906 Duplicate of A020483, assuming that the 3rd definition is also correct. - _R. J. Mathar_, Apr 26 2015
