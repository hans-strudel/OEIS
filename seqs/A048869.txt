%N A048869 Numbers for which reduced residue system contains as many primes as nonprimes.
%C A048869 This sequence is finite, since the number of primes < n is ~ n/log(n), but liminf phi(n) / ( n*log(log(n)) ) = exp(-gamma), a consequence of Mertens's theorem (see Hardy and Wright's Theory of Numbers). Also, if there exists a further element, it is >700000 (as verified with the enclosed Mathematica code). (Question: is it possible to show that there are no further such elements by using explicit bounds in the Prime Number Theorem and in Mertens's theorem?) - Reiner Martin (reinermartin(AT)hotmail.com), Jan 16 2002
%C A048869 There are no terms larger than 10890; it suffices to check to 52024. [_Charles R Greathouse IV_, Dec 19 2011]
%e A048869 n=45, phi(45)=24 and the reduced residue system mod 45 contains 12 primes {2,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43} and 12 nonprimes {1,4,8,14,16,22,26,28,32,34,38,44}.
