%N A046971 Maximal value of number of unitary divisors (see A034444) for integers in binary order range of n.
%C A046971 Q_k the k-th primorial number (A002110) is the smallest positive integer such that its number of unitary divisors (A034444) is 2^k. Thus the binary orders (A029837) of primorial numbers (A045716) determines the maximal values of unitary divisors in binary order ranges.

%F A046971 2^k occurs in the sequence g(Q_k) - g(Q_k-1)+1 times, where g is binary order and Q_k is the k-th primorial number
%e A046971 128 occurs in the sequence from index 19 and 23 inclusively (5 times) because the 7th primorial number Q_7=510510 has binary order 19 and Q_8, the next one is 9699690 has binary order 24 (it is between 2^23 and 2^24).
