%N A055377 a(n) = largest prime <= n/2.
%C A055377 Also largest prime factor of any composite <= n. E.g., a(15) = 7 since 7 is the largest prime factor of {4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15}, the composites <= 15.
%C A055377 Also largest prime dividing A025527(n) = n!/LCM[1,..,n]. [Comment from _Ray Chandler_, Apr 26 2007: Primes > n/2 don't appear as factors of A025507(n) since they appear once in n! and again in the denominator LCM[1,...,n]. Primes <= n/2 appear more times in the numerator than the denominator so they appear in the fraction.]
%F A055377 a(n) = Max(gpf((n+2) mod k): 1<k<(n+2) and k not prime), with gpf=A006530 (greatest prime factor). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Mar 27 2004
%e A055377 n = 10, n! = 3628800, LCM[1,..,10] = 2520, A025527(10) = 1440 = 32*9*5 so a(7) = 5 (offset = 3).
