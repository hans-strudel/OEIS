%N A058989 Largest number of consecutive integers such that each is divisible by a prime <= the n-th prime.
%C A058989 Marty Weissman conjectured that a(n)=2q-1, where q is the largest prime smaller than the n-th prime. The conjecture holds for the first few terms, but then a(n) is larger than 2q-1. Phil Carmody proved a(n)>=2q-1. Terms were calculated by Weissman, Carmody and McCranie.
%C A058989 A049300(n) is the smallest value of the mentioned consecutive integers. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jun 14 2003

%F A058989 a(n) = A048670(n) - 1. See that entry for additional information.
%F A058989 Iwaniec proved that a(n) << n^2 log^2 n. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 08 2012
%F A058989 a(n) >= (2e^gamma + o(1)) n log^2 n log log log n / (log log n)^2, see A048670. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 08 2012
%e A058989 The 4th prime is 7. Nine is the maximum number of consecutive integers such that each is divisible by 2, 3, 5 or 7. (Example: 2 through 10) So a(4)=9.
