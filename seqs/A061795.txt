%N A061795 Number of distinct sums phi(i) + phi(j) for 1<=i<=j<=n, phi(k) = A000010(k).
%e A061795 If the {s+t} sums are generated by adding 2 terms of an S set consisting of n different entries, then at least 1, at most n(n+1)/2=A000217(n) distinct values can be obtained. The set of first n Phi-values gives results falling between these two extremes. E.g. n=10, A000010:{1,1,2,2,4,2,6,4,6,4...}. Additions provide {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12}, i.e. 9 different results. Thus a(10)=9.
