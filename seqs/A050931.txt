%N A050931 Solutions c of cot(2*Pi/3)*(-(a+b+c)*(-a+b+c)*(-a+b-c)*(a+b-c))^(1/2)=a^2+b^2-c^2, c>a,b integers.
%C A050931 Also the c-values for solutions to c^2 = a^2 + ab + b^2 in positive integers. Also the numbers which occur as the longest side of some triangle with integer sides and a 120-degree angle. - _Paul Boddington_, Nov 05 2007
%C A050931 The sequence can also be defined as the numbers w which are Heronian means of two distinct positive integers u and v, i.e., w = [u+sqrt(uv)+v]/3. E.g., 28 is the Heronian mean of 4 and 64 (and also of 12 and 48). - _Pahikkala Jussi_, Feb 16 2008
%C A050931 From _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Nov 24 2013: (Start)
%C A050931 This sequence is the analog of hypotenuse numbers A009003 for triangles with integer sides and a 120-degree angle. There are two integers a and b > 0 such that a(n)^2 = a^2 + ab + b^2, and a, b and a(n) are the sides of the triangle: a(n) is the sequence of lengths of the longest side of these triangles. A004611 is the same for primitive triangles.
%C A050931 a and b cannot be equal because sqrt(3) is not rational. Then the values a(n) are such that a(n)^2 is in A024606. It follows that a(n) is the sequence of multiples of primes of form 6k+1 A002476.
%C A050931 The sequence is closed under multiplication. The primitive elements are those with exactly one prime divisor of the form 6k+1 with multiplicity one, which are also those for which there exists a unique 120-degree integer triangle with its longest side equals to a(n).
