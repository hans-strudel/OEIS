%N A056055 Integers > 1 where the decimal expansion of 1/n contains n as a string (if 1/n is finite, trailing zeros do not count).
%C A056055 The sequence is probably infinite, since long-period primes (cf. A006883) especially with high first digit are likely candidates, but is there a proof? Does any n with finite expansion of 1/n (i.e. n = 2^k * 5^m) occur?

%e A056055 118 is okay, since 1/118 = 0.00847457627118... contains "118", 100 is not in it because 1/100 = 0.01 does not contain "100" (0.0100 does not count)
