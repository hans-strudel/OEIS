%N A054542 A Catalan-like sequence.
%C A054542 This sequence (k=2, p=2) belongs to a family of Catalan-like sequences that merit further investigation. The ceiling is taken in order to eliminate the fractional parts. Are there combinations of k and p for which the ceiling is unnecessary?
%D A054542 Felix Goldberg, A problem relating to a family of Catalan-like sequences, forthcoming.
%F A054542 a(n) = Ceiling ( 1/(n+k)*C(pn, n) ), where k=2, p=2 (in the standard Catalan sequence k=1 and p=2).
%e A054542 a(6)=116 because 1/(6+2)*C(12,6) is 115.5 and taking the ceiling we obtain 116.
%Y A054542 Cf. A000108.
%K A054542 nonn
%O A054542 1,2
