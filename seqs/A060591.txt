%N A060591 Integers i > 1 for which there is no prime p such that i is a solution mod p of x^3 = 2.
%C A060591 Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p-1. The following equivalences holds for i > 1: There is a prime p such that i is a solution mod p of x^3 = 2 iff i^3-2 has a prime factor > i; i is a solution mod p of x^3 = 2 iff p is a prime factor of i^3-2 and p > i.
%F A060591 Integer i > 1 is a term of this sequence iff i^3-2 has no prime factor > i.
%e A060591 a(1) = 113, since there is no prime p such that 113 is a solution mod p of x^3 = 2 and for each integer i from 2 to 112 there is a prime q such that i is a solution mod q of x^3 = 2 (cf. A059940).
%Y A060591 A040028, A059940.
