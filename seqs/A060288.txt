%N A060288 Distinct (non-overlapping) twin Harshad numbers whose sum is prime.
%C A060288 Suggested by Puzzle 129, The Prime Puzzles and Problems Connection
%e A060288 a(3)=19, a prime, because the first Harshad number is 9 and the second is 10 and 9+10=19. To find the Harshad numbers take H1=(p-1)/2 as the first Harshad and then the second Harshad, H2=H1+1. Harshad numbers are those which have integral quotients after division by the sum of their digits. Note that 2+3=5 is not included because 1+2=3 are the first twins whose sum is prime and the next twins, 3+4=7, must not overlap the preceding pair.
