%N A030222 Number of n-polyplets (polyominoes connected at edges or corners); may contain holes.
%C A030222 See A056840 for illustrations, valid also for this sequence up to n=4, but slightly misleading for polyplets with holes. See the colored areas in the illustration of A056840(5)=99 which correspond to identical 5-polyplets. (The 2+2+4-3 = 5 additional figures counted there correspond to the 4-square configuration with a hole inside ({2,4,6,8} on a numeric keyboard), with one additional square added in three inequivalent places: "inside" one angle (touching two sides), attached to one side, and attached to a corner. These do only count for 3 here, but for 8 in A056840.) It can be seen that A056840 counts a sort of "spanning trees" instead, i.e., simply connected graphs that connect all of the vertices (using only "King's moves", and maybe other additional constraints). - _M.
