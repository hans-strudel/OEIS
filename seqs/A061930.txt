%N A061930 Square array read by antidiagonals of T(n,k)=T(n-1,[k/2])+T(n-1,[k/3]) with T(0,0)=1.
%e A061930 T(9, 7) = T(8, [7/2])+T(8, [7/3]) = T(8, 3)+T(8, 2) = 256+256 = 512. Rows start (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...), (2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ...), (4, 4, 4, 4, 3, ...) etc.
%Y A061930 Row sums are 5^n, i.e. A000351. Each row starts with 2^n copies of 2^n, i.e. A000079 and then continues with A036561 copies of other terms in the rows of A055248. Cf. A061929.
