%N A009177 Numbers that are the hypotenuses of more than one Pythagorean triangle.
%C A009177 Also, hypotenuses of pythagorean triangles in pythagorean triples (a, b, c, a < b < c) such that a and b are the hypotenuses of pythagorean triangles, where the pythagorean triples (x1, y1, a) and (x2, y2, b) are similar triangles. Sequence gives c values. - _Naohiro Nomoto_
%C A009177 Any multiple of a member of this sequence is also a member. The primitive elements are the products of two primes, not necessarily distinct, that are == 1 (mod 4): A121387. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Dec 21 2015
%H A009177 Robert Israel, <a href="/A009177/b009177.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%H A009177 <a href="/index/Su#ssq">Index entries for sequences related to sums of squares</a>
%F A009177 Of the form b(i)*b(j)*k, where b(n) is A004431(n). Numbers whose prime factorization includes at least 2 (not necessarily distinct) primes congruent to 1 mod 4. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 03 2006. [Typo corrected by _Ant King_, Jul 17 2008]
%e A009177 25^2 = 24^2 + 7^2 = 20^2 + 15^2.
%e A009177 E.g., (a = 15, b = 20, c = 25, a^2 + b^2=c^2); 15 and 20 are the hypotenuses of Pythagorean triangles. The Pythagorean triples (9, 12, 15) and (12, 16, 20) are similar triangles. So c = 25 is in the sequence. - _Naohiro Nomoto_
