%N A001074 Numbers n such that Sum_{k=0..n-1} exp(2*Pi*i*k^3/n) != 0.
%C A001074 Mark n points around horizontal disk with labels 0..n-1; place coins at positions k^3 mod n for k=0..n-1; sequence gives n's for which disk does not balance.
%H A001074 T. D. Noe, <a href="/A001074/b001074.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..1000</a>
%e A001074 8 is in sequence because 4 coins go at 0, 1 each at 1, 3, 5, 7, so disk is unbalanced in direction of point 0. 12 is not in sequence because there are 2 coins at 0, 4, 8; 1 coin at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, so disk balanced.
%t A001074 Select[Range[300], Sum[Exp[2 Pi*I*k^3/#], {k, 0, # - 1}] != 0 &] (* _T. D. Noe_, Jun 25 2012 *)
