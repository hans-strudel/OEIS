%N A062167 Number of permutations with at most 2 queens on any torus diagonal, solutions congruent on the torus count only once.
%C A062167 This sequence counts classes of "near n-queens solutions". Permutations with at most 1 queen on any torus diagonal are exactly the torus n queen solutions (A007705), those with at most 2 contain the normal n queen solutions (A000170).
%C A062167 Therefore they may be called "near n-queens solutions". In this sequence, permutations p and q are considered equivalent iff there are natural x and y, such that, for all k from {0, ..., n-1}, q (k + x mod n) = p (k) + y mod n, or q is a rotation or a reflection of such a q. In other words, rotations, reflections and torus shifts are allowed. The sequence contains the objects of A062164.
