%N A005007 Number of cubic (i.e., regular of degree 3) generalized Moore graphs with 2n nodes.
%C A005007 A generalized Moore graph is a regular graph of degree r where the counts of vertices at each distance from any vertex are 1, r, r(r-1), r(r-1)^2, r(r-1)^3, ... with the last distance having every other vertex. That is, all the levels are full except possibly the last which must have the rest. Alternatively, the girth is as great as the naive bound allows and the diameter is as little as the naive bound allows. Or, the average distance between pairs of vertices achieves the naive lower bound. As far as I know, it is an open problem if there are infinitely many generalized Moore graphs of each degree. - _Brendan McKay_, Oct 06 2003
