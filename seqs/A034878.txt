%N A034878 Numbers n such that n! can be written as the product of smaller factorials.
%C A034878 Except for the numbers 2, 9 and 10 this sequence is conjectured to be the same as A001013.
%C A034878 Every r! is a member for r>2, for (r!)! = (r!)*(r!-1)!. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Sep 11 2002
%C A034878 By Murthy's trick, if n>2 is a product of factorials then n is a member. So half of the above conjecture is true: A001013 is a subsequence except for the number 2. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Nov 08 2004
