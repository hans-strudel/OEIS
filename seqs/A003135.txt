%N A003135 n! is a nontrivial product of factorials. It is conjectured that the list is complete.
%C A003135 A "nontrivial" solution is one in which the largest x! in the product of a(n)! is such that x < a(n)-1. There are no other terms < 10^5. - _Jud McCranie_, Jun 15 2005

%e A003135 9! = 2! * 3! * 3! * 7! and 7 < 9-1, so 9 is in the sequence.
%e A003135 10! = 6! * 7! or 10! = 3! * 5! * 7! and 7 < 10-1, so 10 is in the sequence.
%e A003135 16! = 2! * 5! * 14! and 14 < 16-1, so 16 is in the sequence.
