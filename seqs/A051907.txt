%N A051907 Number of ways to express 1 as the sum of distinct unit fractions such that the sum of the denominators is n.
%H A051907 <a href="/index/Ed#Egypt">Index entries for sequences related to Egyptian fractions</a>
%e A051907 1 = 1/2+1/4+1/9+1/12+1/18 = 1/2+1/5+1/6+1/12+1/20. The sum of the denominators of each of these is 45, these are the only 2 with sum of denominators = 45, so a(45)=2.
%Y A051907 A051882 lists n such that a(n)=0.
%K A051907 nonn
%O A051907 1,45
%A A051907 _Jud McCranie_, Dec 16 1999
%E A051907 R. L. Graham showed that a(n)>0 for n>77.
