%N A060942 a(n) is the largest integer m such that m is divisible by every integer in the interval 1 <= x <= m^(1/n).
%C A060942 Probably this is a subsequence of A003418 but I do not have a proof at the moment.
%e A060942 a(3) = 420 because 420^(1/3) = 7.4888..., 420 is divisible by all of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and it is the largest such number with respect to the exponent 1/3.
%Y A060942 A003418.
%K A060942 nonn
%O A060942 1,1
