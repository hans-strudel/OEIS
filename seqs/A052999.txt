%N A052999 Take n-th prime p, let P = all primes that can be obtained by permuting the digits of p and possibly adding or omitting zeros; a(n) = |p-q| where q in P is the closest to p but different from p (a(n)=0 if no such q exists).
%e A052999 a(6)=18 since 6th prime is 13 and 31-13=18. a(9)=1980 because 9th prime is 23 and the smallest prime in P different from 23 is 2003; 2003-23=1980.
