%N A060274 Hard numbers: a(n) = smallest number m with f(m) = n, where f(m) is the smallest number of digits that are needed to construct m using only 1's, 2's and any number of +, -, *, ^ signs, not allowing concatenation of the digits.
%C A060274 It seems that to obtain this sequence we need to impose the additional rule that x-y is allowed only when x-y > 0.
%C A060274 This is not correct. See the comment at A099053. _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Feb 14 2013
