%N A038775 a[n] is the number of cycles of the permutation that converts forest[n] of depth-first planar planted binary trees into breadth-first representation.
%e A038775 a[5]=10 since there are 10 cycles in this permutation of forest[5], with lengths 1, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 16, 8, 2, 2 summing up to 42=cat[5].
%Y A038775 The first a[n] terms of A038774 add up to cat[n].
