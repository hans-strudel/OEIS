%N A060447 Cyclic token-passing numbers with pattern 121: players 1, 2, ..., n are seated around a table. Each has a penny. Player 1 passes a penny to player 2, who passes two pennies to player 3, who passes a penny to player 4. Player 4 passes a penny to player 5, who passes two pennies to player 6, who passes a penny to player 7 and so on, players passing 1,2,1,1,2,1,... pennies to the next player who still has some pennies. A player who runs out of pennies drops out of the game and leaves the table. Sequence gives number of players remaining when game reaches periodic state.
