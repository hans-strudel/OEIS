K. Guy_, Oct 22 2004: (Start)I got the no-three-in-line problem from Heilbronn over 50 years ago. See Section F4 in UPINT.In Canad. Math. Bull. 11 (1968) 527-531, MR 39 #129, Guy & Kelly conjecture that, for large n, at most (c + eps)n points can be selected, where 3c^3 = 2Pi^2 i.e. c ~ 1.87.As recently as last March, Gabor Ellmann pointed out an error in our heuristic reasoning, which, when corrected, gives 3c^2 = Pi^2, or c ~ 1.813799.
