Define a tournament on the vertex set {2,3,..,n} by: for i < j, i is adjacent to j if i divides j, else j is adjacent to i. If T(n) denotes its adjacency matrix, then the above sequence is det(T(n))for n=4,5,6....42.","comments":"MATLAB program was used to generate the tournament matrices T(n) and evaluate determinants.
