The map is x -> Ax mod 1 for x in [0,1)^10, where A is the companion matrix for the polynomial x^10+x^9-x^7-x^6-x^5-x^4-x^3+x+1.","comments":"It is expected that the sequence contains infinitely many squares of primes. The heuristics for the Mersenne sequence can be adapted to show that approximately c log N of the first N terms should be prime. The paper Einsiedler, Everest, Ward gives supporting numerical evidence.The terms in this sequence are all squares. The sequence of square roots, A087612, is conjectured to contain an infinite number of primes. - _T. D. Noe_, Sep 15 2003","references":["M. Einsiedler, G. Everest, T.
