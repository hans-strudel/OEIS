These dynamical systems arise naturally in arithmetic and are built by making an isometric extension of a familiar hyperbolic system. The extension destroys some of the periodic points, in this case reducing the original number 2^n-1 by factoring out any 3's. An interesting feature is that the logarithmic growth rate is still log 2.A059990[n+7] times some power of 3 seems to me the greatest common Denominator of A035522[4n+16+1],A035522[4n+16+2],A035522[4n+16+3] and A035522[4n+16+4] for n>1 [From _Dylan Hamilton_, Aug 04 2010]","references":["V.
