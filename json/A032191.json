Therefore by Polya enumeration a(n+6) is the number of cyclically inequivalent 6-necklaces whose 6 beads are labeled with nonnegative integers such that the sum of labels is n, for n=0,1,2,... See A102190 for Z(C_6,x). Note the equivalence of this formulation with the one given in the `Name' line: start with a black 6-necklace (all 6 beads have labels 0). Insert after each of the 6 black beads k white ones if the label was k and then forget about the labels. _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 15 2005.","links":["C. G.
