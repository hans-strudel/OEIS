Roughly said, a spoof-perfect number is a number that would be perfect if one or more of its composite factors were wrongly assumed to be prime, i.e., taken as a \"spoof prime\". - _Daniel Forgues_, Nov 15 2009 (slightly rephrased)The right hand side of the second equation in the definition, 2n = ..., equals the sum of divisors sigma(n), if all of the f_i are distinct primes. If they aren't, there arise some ambiguities: See A174292 for further discussion. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 13 2013","references":["R. K.
