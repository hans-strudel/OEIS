F. Hasler_, Oct 14 2008: (Start)X^9 = I <=> I - X^9 = 0 <=> (I - X)^9 = 0 in GF(3). So to any solution of the first equation corresponds a solution X' = I-X of the other equation and vice versa. On the other hand, from considerations about the matrix rank (e.g., reasoning in Jordan basis) it is known that to check for nilpotency it is sufficient to go up to an exponent equal to the size of the matrix.Thus by going out to the 9th power one finds all nilpotent matrices for sizes <= 9 X 9. Since A053854 is only given up to n=9, we can't see if A053764(10) is strictly bigger than A053854(10), which seems very likely since from then on there should be more matrices that satisfy A^10=0 than there are matrices satisfying A^9=0.
