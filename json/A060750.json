Here we do not accept 0 as a valid number of shuffles and so we say that card #1 first shows up on top after 3 shuffles. A060751 and A060752 also adopt this convention. Alternatively, we can say that card #1 first shows up on top after 0 shuffles; this leads to sequences A035490, A057983, A057984, etc.","references":["See A035490 for references, links and programs."],"crossrefs":["Cf.
