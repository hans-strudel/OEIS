An entry j of a permutation p is isolated if it is not preceded by j-1 and not followed by j+1. For example, the permutation 23178564 has 2 isolated entries: 1 and 4. a(1)=11 because in 123, 1'3'2', 2'1'3', 231', 3'12, and 3'2'1' we have a total of 11 isolated entries (they are marked).a(n)=Sum(k*A180196(n+2,k), k>=0).(End)","references":["N.
