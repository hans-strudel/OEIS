Simply interpret R,L,O as instructions to turn R, turn L, or retrace the last step. Walks are not self-avoiding.Also, it appears that a(n) gives the number of equivalence classes of n-tuples of 0, 1 and 2, where two n-tuples are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of operations R and C, where R denotes reversal and C denotes taking the 2's complement (C(x)=2-x). This has been verified up to a(19)=290585050. Example: for n=3 there are ten equivalence classes {000, 222}, {001, 100, 122, 221}, {002, 022, 200, 220}, {010, 212}, {011, 110, 112, 211}, {012, 210}, {020, 202}, {021, 102, 120, 201}, {101, 121}, {111}, so a(3)=10. - _John W. Layman_, Oct 13 2009There exists a bijection between chains of n+2 hexagons and the above described equivalence classes of n-tuples of 0,1, and 2. Namely, for a given chain of n+2 hexagons we take the sequence of the numbers of vertices of degree 2 (0, 1, or 2) between the consecutive contact vertices on one side of the chain; switching to the other side we obtain the 2's complement of this sequence; reversing the order of the hexagons, we obtain the reverse sequence. The inverse mapping is straightforward. For example, to a linear chain of 7 hexagons there corresponds the 5-tuple 11111. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Apr 22 2013","references":["A. T.
