[This comment was erroneously attached to A011971, but really belongs here. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 02 2015]From David Pasino (davepasino(AT)yahoo.com), Apr 15 2009: (Start)As an infinite lower-triangular matrix (with offset 0 rather than 1, so the entries would be B(n - c)*binomial(n, c), B() a Bell number, rather than B(n - 1 - c)*binomial(n - 1, c) as below), this array is S P S^-1 where P is the Pascal matrix A007318, S is the Stirling2 matrix A048993, and S^-1 is the Stirling1 matrix A048994.Also, S P S^-1 = (1/e)*exp(P). (End)Exponential Riordan array [exp(exp(x)-1),x]. Equal to A007318*A124323. - _Paul Barry_, Apr 23 2009Equal to A049020*A048994 as infinite lower triangular matrices. - _Philippe Deléham_, Nov 19 2011Build a superset Q[n] of set partitions of {1,2,...,n} by distinguishing \"some\" (possibly none or all) of the singletons. Indexed from n>=0, 0<=k<=n, T(n,k) is the number of elements in Q[n] that have exactly k distinguished singletons. A singleton is a subset containing one element. T(3,1) = 6 because we have {{1}'{2,3}}, {{1,2}{3}'}, {{1,3}{2}'}, {{1}'{2}{3}}, {{1}{2}'{3}}, {{1}{2}{3}'}. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Nov 10 2012Let Bell(n,x) denote the n-th Bell polynomial, the n-th row polynomial of A048993. Then this is the triangle of connection constants when expressing the basis polynomials Bell(n,x + 1) in terms of the basis polynomials Bell(n,x). For example, row 3 is (5, 6, 3, 1) and 5 + 6*Bell(1,x) + 3*Bell(2,x) + Bell(3,x) = 5 + 6*x + 3*(x + x^2) + (x + 3*x^2 + x^3) = 5 + 10*x + 6*x^2 + x^3 = (x + 1) + 3*(x + 1)^2 + (x + 1)^3 = Bell(3,x + 1). - _Peter Bala_, Sep 17 2013","references":["W.
