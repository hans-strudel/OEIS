The composition of these two operations is rotation by 90 degrees, and so permutations fixed by this composition correspond to rotationally symmetric rook diagrams by taking the associated permutation matrix.

We may also replace \"reversing\" with \"complementing\" in the preceding sentences, where the complement of (w(1), ..., w(n)) is (n + 1 - w(1), ..., n + 1 - w(n)). [_Joel B.
