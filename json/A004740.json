[Obviously Smarandache did not take such numbers into account. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 25 2010.]However, it would seem then that 'billion' and 'centillion' also precede these, while it is standard (and systematic for this sequence) to refer to such numbers as 'one billion', 'one decillion' etc. - Yasiru Ratnayake, May 03 2012","references":["F.
