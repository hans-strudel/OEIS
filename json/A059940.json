The following equivalences hold for n > 1: There is a prime p such that n is a solution mod p of x^3 = 2 iff n^3-2 has a prime factor > n; n is a solution mod p of x^3 = 2 iff p is a prime factor of n^3-2 and p > n.n^3-2 has at most two prime factors > n, consequently these factors are the only primes p such that n is a solution mod p of x^3 = 2. For n such that n^3-2 has no prime factor > n (the zeros in the sequence; they occur beyond the last entry shown in the database) see A060591. For n such that n^3-2 has two prime factors > n, cf. A060914.","formula":"If n^3-2 has prime factors > n, then a(n) = least of these prime factors, else a(n) = 0.","example":"a(2) = 3, since 2 is a solution mod 3 of x^3 = 2 and 2 is not a solution mod p of x^3 = 2 for prime p = 2.
