Conjecture: every Pythagorean prime appears in a(n) at least once.Problem 11831 [Ozols 2015] is to prove that lim inf a(n)/n is zero. - _Michael Somos_, May 11 2015From _Michael Kaltman_, Jun 10 2015: (Start)For all numbers k in A256011, a(k) < k.Conjecture: every Pythagorean prime p appears exactly two times among the first p integers of the sequence. Further: if a(i) = a(j) = p and both i and j are less than p (and i is not equal to j), then i + j = p and ij == 1 mod p. [If a(k) = p as well, then k > p; in fact, k is in A256011.] Two examples: a(2) = a(3) = 5, with 2+3 = 5 and 2*3 = 6 == 1 mod 5; a(4) = a(13) = 17, with 4+13 = 17 and 4*13 = 52 == 1 mod 17.(End)The conjecture is true. If p is a Pythagorean prime, -1 is a quadratic residue mod p. Then -1 has exactly two square roots mod p, i.e., there are exactly two integers x,y with 1 <= x,y <= p-1 such that x^2 == y^2 == -1 mod p, i.e., p divides x^2+1 and y^2+1, and moreover y == -x mod p so x + y = p, and x y == -x^2 == 1 mod p. Any other prime factor q of x^2 + 1 must divide (x^2+1)/p, and since x^2+1 < p^2 we have q < p, so a(x) = p and similarly a(y) = p. - _Robert Israel_, Jun 11 2015Conjecture: if n is even and a(n)>n, then n+a(n) is in A256011. Examples: 2+a(2) = 2+5 = 7, 4+a(4) = 4+17 = 21, 6+a(6) = 6+37 = 43, and so on. Note that 18+a(18) is NOT in A256011, but 18 itself is. - _Michael Kaltman_, Jun 13 2015This is also true. Suppose A = a(n) > n. n^2+1 is odd so A is an odd prime; n^2 + 1 = A B with B < A also odd. Then (A+n)^2 + 1 = A (A+2 n+B) and A+2 n+B is even. The largest prime factor of A+2 n+B is thus at most (A+2 n+B)/2 < A + n, while A < A + n as well. - _Robert Israel_, Jun 17 2015","references":["H.
