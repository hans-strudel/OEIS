If an odd term n>1 exists then n = m*2^k + 1 for some k>=1 and odd m. Then n divides 2^(m*2^k) + 1 and so does every prime factor p of n, implying that 2^(k+1) divides the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p and thus p-1. Therefore n = m*2^k + 1 is the product of prime factors of the form t*2^(k+1) + 1, implying that n-1 is divisible by 2^(k+1), a contradiction. - _Max Alekseyev_, Mar 16 2009The sequence is infinite.
