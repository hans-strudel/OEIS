See the Paterson link for the definition.","comments":"Restatement of the definition: A polydrafter is a polygon formed by joining 30-60-90 triangles, according to the following rules:(a) Two triangles may be joined along their short legs, with their right angles touching;(b) Two triangles may be joined along their long legs, with their right angles touching;(c) Two triangles may be joined along their hypotenuses, in either direction;(d) The short leg of triangle 1 may be joined to half of the hypotenuse of triangle 2, with the right angle of triangle 1 touching the midpoint of the hypotenuse of triangle 2.","references":["Ed Pegg, Jr., Polyform puzzles, in Tribute to a Mathemagician, Peters, 2005, pp. 119-125."],"links":["D.
