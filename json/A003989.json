[Smith, Mansion] - _Michael Somos_, Jun 25 2012Imagine a torus having regular polygonal cross-section of m sides. Now, break the torus and twist the free ends, preserving rotational symmetry, then reattach the ends. Let n be the number of faces passed in twisting the torus before reattaching it. For example, if n = m, then the torus has exactly one full twist. Do this for arbitrary m and n (m > 1, n > 0). Now, count the number of independent, closed paths on the surface of the resulting torus, where a path is \"closed\" if and only if it returns to its starting point after a finite number of times around the surface of the torus. Conjecture: this number is always GCD (m,n). NOTE: This figure constitutes a group with m and n the binary arguments and GCD (m,n) the resulting value. Twisting in the reverse direction is the inverse operation, and breaking & reattaching in place is the identity operation. - _Jason Richardson-White_, May 06 2013Regarded as a triangle, table of gcd(n,k) for 0 < k < n. - _Franklin T.
