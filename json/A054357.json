This may be considered the number of non-crossing partitions of n unlabeled points on a circle, so this sequence has the same relation to the Catalan numbers (A000108) as the number of partitions of an integer (A000041) has to the Bell numbers (A000110). - _Len Smiley_, Sep 06 2005","links":["Miklos Bona, Michel Bousquet, Gilbert Labelle and Pierre Leroux, Enumeration of m-ary cacti, Advances in Applied Mathematics, 24 (2000), 22-56 (<a href=\"http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/~leroux/articles/cactus.pdf\">pdf</a>, <a href=\"http://www.math.ufl.edu/~bona/cactusJCTA.dvi\">dvi</a>).","Tilman Piesk, <a href=\"http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Partition_related_number_triangles#rot\">Partition related number triangles</a>","<a href=\"/index/Ca#cacti\">Index entries for sequences related to cacti</a>"],"crossrefs":["Cf.
