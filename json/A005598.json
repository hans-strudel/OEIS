ABABBBA is impossible, for example, because \"ABA\" implies that the spacing between B's must be greater than 1/2 the spacing between A's. But \"ABBBA\" implies that the B-spacing must be less than 1/2 the A-spacing. - _Allan C. Wechsler_, Mar 16 2005. Since the interchange of A's and B's gives essentially the same order pattern, all terms will be even for n>0.The SemialgebraicComponents procedure in the Algebra`AlgebraicInequalities` package of Mathematica may be used to determine whether a particular pattern is possible. - _John W. Layman_, Mar 30 2005Also, \"digital lines\": number of straight binary strings of length n [Dorst]. This was the original source for this sequence.Also, number of finite Sturmian words of length n. The considered orders are exactly the balanced words, which have been proved to be the factors Sturmian sequences. An explicit formula has been exhibited by Mignosi in 1991. Berstel and Pocchiola gave a geometric proof of this, using Euler function for counting partitions of a unit cube. - Damien Jamet (jamet(AT)lirmm.fr), Apr 01 2005a(n)=Sum{T(i,n-i): i=0,1,...,n}, array T as in A049695. - _Clark Kimberling_The first difference of a(n) is the number of 'special' words, prefix of two Sturmian words of length n+1; see A002088.
