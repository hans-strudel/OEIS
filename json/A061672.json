F. Hasler_, Oct 29 2014: (Start)This is the subsequence of terms of A034710 with digits in nondecreasing order, which is meant by \"smallest\": For example, 132 also has sum of digits = product of digits, but is already \"represented\" by 123. The word \"set\" in the definition actually means \"multiset\".The sequence is infinite: for any number N whose digits form a nondecreasing sequence whose sum of digits S is not larger than the product of digits P (i.e., N in A062998), a term of the sequence is obtained by prefixing N with P-S digits '1'.
