(Start)There are at least five different methods of determining Planck's Constant (h). Listed below are the best estimate CODATA values for each of these five methods as of December 2012.6.6260657(88)*10^(-34) J-s - Faraday Constant method6.6260678(27)*10^(-34) J-s - Josephson Constant method6.62606889(23)*10^(-34) J-s - Watt Balance method6.6260724(57)*10^(-34) J-s - Magnetic resonance method6.6260745(19)*10^(-34) J-s - X-ray crystal density methodObservation: Empirically, as a weighted average, (6.6260657 + 6.6260678 + pi*6.62606889 + 6.6260745 + 6.6260724)*10^-34 Joule*Seconds/(4 + pi) = 6.626069567719... *10^-34 Joule*Seconds. If Watt Balance method then assign a weight of pi. Else, assign weight = 1. Rounded to 8 decimal places this simple weighting gives the CODATA 2010 value for Planck's Constant = 6.62606957*10^(-34) Joule*Seconds. This is a somewhat odd coincidence given that the CODATA 2010 value was based not upon a weighted average of these measurements, but, as per the Wikipedia link below, \"on three watt-balance measurements of K_J^2*R_K and one inter-laboratory determination of the molar volume of silicon.\" (end)","references":["H.
