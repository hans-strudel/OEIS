In fact, there appear to be exactly p-1 values of a with 1 <= a <= p^2 for which a^(p-1)=1 (mod p^2). See A096082 for the related open problem. - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 24 2008That there are exactly p-1 values of 1 <= a <= p^2 for which a^(p-1)==1 (mod p^2) follows immediately from Hensel's lifting lemma and Fermat's little theorem - every solution mod p corresponds to a unique solution mod p^2. - _Phil Carmody_, Jan 10 2011If the ABC-(k,epsilon) conjecture holds (for all k >= 2 and epsilon > 0), then infinitely many terms are -1 (see the paper by Broughan). - _Felix Fröhlich_, Jun 24 2014","references":["P.
