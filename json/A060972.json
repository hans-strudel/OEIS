So the sum of each row is given by A005315. The outer columns consist of 1's. The next-to-outer columns are given by A002415.This is also the number of arches above the x-axis going from an odd vertex to a higher even vertex(p) for closed plane meanders(M) with n arches. By symmetry, these same subsets exist for arches below the x-axis. For each meander solution, the total arches for the top and bottom that go from an odd vertex to a higher even vertex is n+1.Example: M(n,p): M(3,1)=1 [(top 16,23,45; bottom 12,34,56)], M(3,2)=6 [(top 14,23,56; bottom 16,25,34)(top 16,25,34; bottom 14,23,56) (top 12,36,45; bottom 16,25,34) (top 16,25,34; bottom 12,36,45) (top 12,36,45; bottom 14,23,56)(top 14,23,56; bottom 12,36,45)] M(3,3)=1 [(top 12,34,56; bottom 16,23,45)]. - _Roger Ford_, Sep 29 2014","links":["Joerg Arndt and Andrew Howroyd, <a href=\"/A060972/b060972.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..210</a> (first 105 terms from Joerg Arndt)","Reinhard O.
