Duke, J. B. Friedlander and H. Iwaniec and A. Toth.Comment from Emmanuel Kowalski, Mar 12 2007 (writing to the Number Theory List): It is known (Duke, Friedlander, Iwaniec, Annals of Math. 141 (1995)) that the fractional part of a(n)/p(n) is equidistributed in [0,1/2] for p(n)<X and X going to infinity. So a positive proportion of p have a between xp and yp for 0<x<y<1/2, but equidistribution in smaller sets is not known.Contribution from _Artur Jasinski_, Dec 10 2008: (Start)If we take 4 numbers : 1, A002314(n), A152676(n), A152680(n) then multiplication table modulo A002144(n) is isomorphic to the Latin square:1 2 3 42 4 1 33 1 4 24 3 2 1and isomorphic to the multiplication table of {1, I, -I, -1} where I is Sqrt[ -1],A152680(n) is isomorphic to -1, A002314(n) with I or -I and A152676(n) vice versa -I or I.1, A002314(n), A152676(n), A152680(n) are subfield of Galois Field [A002144(n)].
