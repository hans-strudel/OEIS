{"formerly":"","seq":"3,5,7,29,51,151,601,1631,7159,19145,71515,378701","description":"Hard numbers: a(n) = smallest number m with f(m) = n, where f(m) is the smallest number of digits that are needed to construct m using only 1's, 2's and any number of +, -, *, ^ signs, allowing concatenation of the digits.","comments":"It seems that to obtain this sequence we need to impose two additional rules: 1. x-y is allowed only when x-y > 0 (which also applies to A060274). 2. \"Allowing concatenation of the digits\" *only* applies to the base digits, 1 and 2, not to the decimal representations of subexpression values. So for example, 13 cannot be obtained via: 13 = 1 concat 3 = 1 concat (1+2) because \"3\" is not a string consisting solely of 1's or 2's, but can be obtained via: 13 = 11 + 2 = (1 concat 1) + 2. Then the example 151 really does have complexity 7 under this measure.","references":["C. Pickover, Mazes for the Mind, St. Martin's Press, NY, 1992, p. 376.","C.
