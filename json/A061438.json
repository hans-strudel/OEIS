Other values of m and p also converge but not necessarily to 1. For m =2 and p=1 we have the count of steps for the x+1 problem. m=prime and p=m+1 usually converge to 1 but break down for certain values of n. E.g. 17 locks at n=34, 23 at n=49, 29 at n=91. I verified m=13 for n up to 100000. 100000 requires 100 steps to reach 1.","links":["Harvey P.
