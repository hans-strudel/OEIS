If p-1 has other prime factors, p is in class (c+1)-, where c- is the largest class of its prime factors. See also A005109.a(18) <= 619108107719, a(19) <= 19811459447009, a(20) <= 152772264735359. These upper limits can be found by generating class (n+1)- primes from a list of n- class primes; if the latter is sufficiently complete, one can deduce that there is no smaller (n+1)- prime. - _M.
