A 1 is bad if it is immediately followed by two or more 1's and then a 0; otherwise it is good. In particular, a 1 with no 0's to its right is good. For example, 110101110111 is 1100-avoiding and only the 1 in position 6 is bad and T(4,3) counts 0111, 1011, 1101. - _David Callan_, Jul 25 2005The matrix inverse starts:1;-1,1;1,-2,1;-1,3,-3,1;1,-4,6,-4,1;-2,8,-13,11,-5,1;8,-30,45,-36,18,-6,1;-36,137,-207,163,-78,27,-7,1;192,-732,1112,-884,425,-144,38,-8,1;- _R.
