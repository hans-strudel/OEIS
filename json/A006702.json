D. Noe, May 19 2007Apparently the generating function of the sequence of the denominators of continued fraction convergents to sqrt(n) is always rational and of form p(x)/[1 - C*x^m + x^(2m)], or equivalently, the denominators satisfy the linear recurrence b(n+2m) = C*b(n+m) - b(n). If so, then it seems that a(n) is half the value of C for each nonsquare n, or 1. See A003285 for the conjecture regarding m. The same conjectures apply to the sequences of the numerators of continued fraction convergents to sqrt(n). - _Ralf Stephan_, Dec 12 2013","references":["A.
