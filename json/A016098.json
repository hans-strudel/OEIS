Noncrossing partitions are also called \"planar rhyme schemes\". - _Peter Luschny_, Apr 28 2011Bell numbers (A000110) minus Catalan numbers (A000108). - Robert G. Wilson vConsider a set of A000217(n) balls of n colors in which, for each integer k = 1 to n, exactly one color appears in the set a total of k times. (Each ball has exactly one color and is indistinguishable from other balls of the same color.) a(n+1) equals the number of ways to choose 0 or more balls of each color while satisfying the following conditions:1. No two colors are chosen the same positive number of times.2. Among colors chosen at least once, there exists at least one pair of colors (c, d) such that color c is chosen more times than color d, but color d appears more times in the original set than color c.If the second requirement is removed, the number of acceptable ways to choose equals A000110(n+1). The number of ways that meet the first requirement, but fail to meet the second, equals A000108(n+1).
