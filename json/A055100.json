In backgammon, if a double is rolled then the number is played four times, not twice. Hence a roll of 22 hits a blot 8 pips away.","example":"a(1)=11 since only these rolls hit: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61. a(8)=6 since only these rolls hit: 22, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62. a(13)=0 since no roll hits.","keyword":"easy,fini,full,nonn","offset":"1,1","author":"David Brotherton (dbroth02(AT)aol.com), Jun 13 2000"}
