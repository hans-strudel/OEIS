It is not known whether there is an efficient (linear in log(m)+log(n)) strategy to compute Wythoff(m,n). Each single row is \"easy\" in the sense that a+n-Wythoff(a,n) is eventually periodic. - _Howard A. Landman_.Inverse of sequence A048850 considered as a permutation of the nonnegative integers. - _Howard A. Landman_, Sep 25 2001Comments from _Howard A. Landman_, Nov 24 2007 (Start): It is impossible for any integer to appear twice in this sequence because of the way it is constructed. Thus to prove that it is a permutation of the integers, we need only show that every value g appears at least once.Suppose this was not true; then there must be some g such that for any value of n, G(n,n) is not = g. Since G(n,n) is defined as the smallest number not found as a G(k,n), G(n,k), or G(k,k) for k < n, this can only happen in one of 2 ways; either there is a number g' smaller than g which is chosen (this can occur at most g times) or g already appears as both G(n,k) and G(k,n) for some k < n (because G(n,k) = G(k,n)) (this can happen at most n/2 times).Thus we have n <= n/2 + g, or n <= 2g; if g has not appeared within the first 2g terms we have a contradiction. Therefore not only must every integer g appear in the sequence, but it must appear within the first 2g terms (and no sooner than term g/2, since G(n,n) <= 2n). Conversely, this also proves that n/2 <= A(n) = G(n,n) <= 2n. (End)","references":["E. R. Berlekamp, J. H. Conway and R. K.
