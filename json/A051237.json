(Cf. A010551(n-2), n >= 2.)The number of ways of arranging row n to get a prime pyramid is given by A036440. List them in lexicographic order and pick the first (earliest) to get row n of lexicographically earliest prime pyramid.Prime pyramids are also (more fittingly?) called prime triangles. (End)It appears that the limit of the rows of the lexicographically earliest prime pyramid is A055265 (see comment on that sequence).Assuming Dickson's conjecture (or the later Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture B), no backtracking is needed: if the first n-2 elements in each row are chosen greedily, a penultimate member can be chosen such that its sums are prime. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 18 2011","references":["R.
