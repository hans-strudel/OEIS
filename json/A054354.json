Thus, for all n>=1, a(n) is in {-1, 0, 1}, a(n+1) != a(n), and if a(n) = 0, a(n+1) = -a(n-1), while if a(n) != 0, either a(n+1) = 0 and a(n+2) = -a(n) or a(n+1) = -a(n). A further consequence is that the maximum gap between equal values is 4: for all n, there is an integer k, 1<k<=4 such that a(n+k)=a(n). - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Oct 05 2014From _Daniel Forgues_, Jul 07 2015: (Start)Second differences: {-1, -1, 1, 1, -2, 2, -1, -1, 2, -1, -1, 1, 1, ...}The sequence of first differences bounces between -1 and 1 with a slope whose absolute value is either 1 or 2. We can compress the information in the second differences into {-1, 1, -2, 2, -1, 2, -1, 1, ...} since the -1 and the 1 come in pairs; which can be compressed further into {1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, ...} since the signs alternate, where we only need to know that the initial sign is negative.
