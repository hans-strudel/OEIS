J. A. Sloane_: Suppose n is an m-digit number and write n/(10^m-1) in lowest terms as r/s.A necessary condition for k to exist is that 2^w*5^x=r (mod s) be solvable for w and x. This certainly fails for s=1353 and some r, since 2 and 5 have order 20 mod s and 20*20<phi(1353)=800.So certainly a(n)=0 for some numbers n with 800 digits. When is the first time a(n)=0?After finding a(n) for n up to 100, it is easy to verify that n=101 is the first time a(n)=0. Because 101 is a 3-digit number, m=3. In lowest terms, r/s = 101/999 because 101 is prime. Modulo 999, both 2^w and 5^x have period 36. Checking the 36^2 values of 2^w*5^x mod 999, we find none equal to 101 (or 110 or 011). - T. D.
