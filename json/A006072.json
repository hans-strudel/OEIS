F. Hasler_, May 08 2013The number of n-digit terms is given by A225367 -- which counts palindromes in base 3, A118594. The terms here are the base 3 palindromes considered there, with 2 replaced by 8 (which means this sequence A006072 arises from A118594 not only by taking the 3rd power of each digit, but also by superposing the number with its horizontal or vertical reflection, somehow remarkably given the symmetry of numbers considered here). - _M.
