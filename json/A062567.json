I found a(3^n) for n<21; A112726 gives this subsequence. From the terms of A112726 we see that for n>4, a(3^n) is much smaller than 10^3^(n-2)-1. It seems that only for n=2,3 & 4 we have a(3^n)=10^3^(n-2)-1. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Nov 13 2005","example":"48 and 84 are both divisible by 12.","mathematica":"Block[{k = 1}, While[ !IntegerQ[k/n] || !IntegerQ[ FromDigits[ Reverse[ IntegerDigits[k]]]/n] && k < 10^5, k++ ]; If[k != 10^5, k, 0]]; Table[ a[n], {n, 1, 60}] (* _Robert G.
