J. A. Sloane_From _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Nov 27 2015: (Start)Removing the final digit listed in the Data section (i.e., a(-52)=1) allows the sequence to be extended so as to yield an arbitrarily large number of terms of agreement by applying the procedure described at the \"Extending\" link at A114376. The best result that can be obtained using a practical number of terms occurs at 639 terms, at which point the decimal expansion is0.10841015122311136151129081140641509112215809093909  09069019090909059090511902221321990909090909090909  09090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909  09090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909  09090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909  09090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909  09090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909  09090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909  09090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909  09090909090909090908909048901190716906290416319090  93290909090714119863113213411290313112190412211159  09090909090719034336219011112622211111473522141512  211290113229051159051901390719090909062and the continued fraction expansion evaluates to0.10841015122311136151129081140641509112215809093909  090690190909090590905119022213219909090...(with the digit pair \"90\" repeating forever), so the two expressions agree through the first 469 digits after the decimal point.The long string of digit pairs \"90\" beginning immediately after the 83rd digit after the decimal point arises from the very close agreement of the decimal expansion and the continued fraction expansion at that point; at 83 terms, the decimal expansion is exactly0.10841015122311136151129081140641509112215809093909  090690190909090590905119022213219and the continued fraction expansion evaluates to0.10841015122311136151129081140641509112215809093909  09070956...yielding agreement through the first 53 digits after the decimal point. After this, the ratio (digits of agreement) / (number of terms) drops rapidly, not returning to similar levels again until the number of terms reaches 639.While it is theoretically possible to extend this sequence arbitrarily far using the same procedure, it is impractical to do so; the agreement using 639 terms is so extremely close that the number of consecutive digit pairs \"90\" (i.e., term pairs (9, 0)) that would immediately follow the 639th term would exceed 5*10^301.
