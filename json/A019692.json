In Treatise on the Circumference published 1424 he calculated the circumference of a unit circle to 9 sexagesimal places. - Peter Harremoës, John W. Nicholson, Aug 02 2012\"Proponents of a new mathematical constant tau (τ), equal to two times π, have argued that a constant based on the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius rather than to its diameter would be more natural and would simplify many formulae\" (from Wikipedia). - _Jonathan Sondow_, Aug 15 2012The constant 2*Pi appears in the formula for the period T of a simple gravity pendulum. For small angles this period is given by Christiaan Huygens’s law, i.e., T = 2*Pi*sqrt(L/g), see for more information A223067. - _Johannes W.
