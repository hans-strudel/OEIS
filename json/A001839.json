Given N items taken three at a time, what is the maximum number of combinations such that no two combinations share more than one item in common. There are reduction rules for 1 in 3 SAT that guarantee no two clauses share more than one variable in common. This series is the maximum number of clauses a reduced instance with N variables can have. Example: a(6)=4: a,b,c)(a,d,e)(b,d,f)(c,e,f). - _Russell Easterly_, Oct 02 2005","references":["P. J.
