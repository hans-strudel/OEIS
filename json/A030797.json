Let z = a + b*i <> 0 be complex, and let z = v^v. Then log(z) + v = v*(1 + log(v)), so f(z, v) = (log(z) + v)/(1 + log(v)) = v. Suppose lim_{n -> infinity} (log(z) + v(n))/(1 + Log(v(n))) = v, for some sequence {v(n)}. Then, since v(n) -> v(n+1), similarly f_(n+1)(z, v) = v(n+1) = (log(z) + v(n))/(1 + log(v(n))). If Im(z) <> 0, recall that log(z) is multi-valued, so one might take both log(z) and log(v(n)) modulo 2*Pi*i. If Im(z) = 0 (i.e., if z is real), then one should use the recurrence f_(n+1)(z, v) = v(n+1) = (log(z) + v(n))/(1 + abs(log(v(n)))). For example, when z = e, we have lim_{n -> infinity} (1 + v(n))/(1 + abs(log(v(n)))) = 1.763222..., for v(0) <> 1/e, with apparent quadratic convergence, and most rapidly when v(0) = 1. Pathologies occur when v(0) is in the vicinity of a fixed point of f(z, v); e.g., if z = 2^(1/4), then such a fixed point is c = 0.806693797003867301..., so f_(n)(z, v) -> c, for all n, with a(0) near c. The constant c was calculated to 250 digits by Joerg Arndt. - _L. Edson Jeffery_, Apr 12 2011","references":["S. R.
