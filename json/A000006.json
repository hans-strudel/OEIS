Cf. A014689. - _Zak Seidov_ Nov 04 2007The above conjecture is Legendre's conjecture that for n > 0 there is always a prime between n^2 and (n+1)^2. See A014085, number of primes between two consecutive squares, which is also the number of times n is repeated in the present sequence. - _Jean-Christophe Herv√©_, Oct 25 2013","references":["M.
