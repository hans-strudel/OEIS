This led him in 1929 to conjecture that its reciprocal was precisely the integer 137. Other physicists neither adopted this conjecture nor accepted his arguments but by the 1940s experimental values deviated sufficiently from 1/137 to refute Eddington's argument. Attempts to find a mathematical basis for this dimensionless constant have continued up to the present time.\" [ Jean-FranÃ§ois Alcover, Sep 01 2011 ]","formula":"a(n)=(1/56)*{58*(n mod 8)-26*[(n+1) mod 8]+58*[(n+2) mod 8]+9*[(n+3) mod 8]-40*[(n+4) mod 8]+44*[(n+5) mod 8]-40*[(n+6) mod 8]+9*[(n+7) mod 8]}, with n>=0 [From _Paolo P.
