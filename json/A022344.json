Only the number 5 or prime factors ending in 1 or 9 form the squarefree portion of a(n). All other factors of a(n) appear only as squares.\"Moreover, the squarefree portion (less the factor 5) squared is the characteristic value of the Fibonacci sequence whose bijection relates to c term of the Horadam \"Fibonacci Number Triples\" Amer. Math. Monthly 68(1961) 751-753. That paper showed that if F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) are 4 sequential numbers in a row of the Wythoff array, then P = (2F(1)*F(2),F(0)*F(1),2F(1)*F(2) + F(0)^2) is a Pythagorean triple (a,b,c) i.e. a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\"If i varies and c(n,2i-1) = F(n,i)^2 + 2F(n,i+1)*F(n,i+2) and C(n,2i) is set to equal C(n,2i+1)-C(n,2i-1) then, the sequence F(x,i) = C(n,i)/G, where G is the greatest common divisor of the adjacent terms C(n,i), is a Fibonacci sequence having the characteristic value which is the square of the squarefree portion of a(n) except without the factor of 5.\"For example the Lucus sequence or the second row of the Wythoff array has the characteristic value of A(2) = 5 and the C(n,i) terms are each 5 times the sequential terms 34,89,233,... which is a bijection of the terms in the 1st row of the Wythoff array which row has the characteristic value of 1. This is so even though adjacent terms of the Lucus sequence are coprime.\" (End)Conjecture: Every pair of Fibonacci sequences, F1 and F2, appear in rows n and m of Wythoff's Array, respectively and have respective characteristics a(n) and a(m). Also, there is a third Fibonacci sequence F3, defined by F3(i) = F1(i) * F2(j+1) - F1(i+1)*F2(j) where j is held constant. The sequence F3 appears in row p of Wythoff's array and has the characteristic a(p) = a(n)*a(m). - _Kenneth J Ramsey_, Feb 11 2007","references":["_Allan C.
