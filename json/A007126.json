Mar 13 2009: Here strength 1 means that the graph is a simple graph (i.e. without multiple edges and loops). Cf. the description of A002854 (number of Euler graphs); and the initial terms 1, 0, 1, 1, 6 can be easily verified. By the way, there is a simple bijective transformation of arbitrary n-graphs into rooted Eulerian (n+1)-graphs: add an external root-vertex and connect it to the odd-valent vertices.","references":["R.
