Two decks each have 5 kinds of cards, n of each kind. The first deck is laid out in order. The second deck is shuffled and laid out next to the first. A match occurs if a card from the second deck is next to a card of the same kind from the first deck. Triangle T(n,k) is the number of ways of achieving exactly k matches (k=0..5n). The probability of exactly k matches is T(n,k)/(5n)!.Rows are of length 1,6,11,16,... = 5n+1 = A016861(n). - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 20 2015","references":["F. N. David and D. E.
