For any of the n^2 initial conditions f(1) and f(2) in Zn, the recursion has a finite period. Each of these n^2 vectors belongs to exactly one orbit. In general, there are only a few different orbit lengths for each n. For n=8, there are 4 different lengths: 1, 3, 6 and 12. The maximum possible length of an orbit is A001175(n), the period of the Fibonacci 2-step sequence mod n. - _T. D. Noe_, May 02 2005","links":["B. Avila and T.
