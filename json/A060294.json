Finch reference). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Nov 02 2003Also the ratio of the average chord length when two points are chosen at random on a circle of radius r to the maximum possible chord length (i.e., diameter) = A088538*r / 2*r = 2/Pi. Is there a (direct or obvious) relationship between this fact and that 2/Pi is the \"magic geometric constant\" for a circle (see MathWorld link)? - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Jun 22 2006Blatner (1997) says that Euler found a \"fascinating infinite product\" for Pi involving the prime numbers, but the number he then describes does not match Pi. Switching the numerator and the denominator results in this number. - _Alonso del Arte_, May 16 20122/Pi is also the height (the ordinate y) of the geometric centroid of each arbelos (see the references and links given under A221918) with a large radius r=1 and any small ones r1 and r2 = 1 - r1, for 0 < r1 < 1. Use the integral formula given, e.g., in the MathWorld or Wikipedia centroid reference, for the two parts of the arbelos (dissected by the vertical line x = 2*r1), and then use the decomposition formula. The heights y1 and y2 of the centroids of the two parts satisfy: F1(r1)*y1(r1) = 2*r1^2*(1-r1) and F2(1-r1)*y2(1-r1) = 2*(1-r1)^2*r1. The r1 dependent area F = F1 + F2 is Pi*r1*(1-r1). (F1 and F2 are rather complicated but their explicit formulas are not needed here.) The r1 dependent horizontal coordinate x with origin at the left tip of the arbelos is x = r1 + 1/2. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 28 2013Construct a quadrilateral of maximal area inside a circle. The quadrilateral is necessarily an inscribed square (with diagonals that are diameters). 2/Pi is the ratio of the square's area to the circle's area. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Aug 02 2014The expected number of real roots of a real polynomial of degree n varies as this constant times the (natural) logarithm of n, see Kac, when its coefficients are chosen from the standard uniform distribution. This may be related to Rick Shepherd's comment. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 06 2014","references":["David Blatner, The Joy of Pi.
