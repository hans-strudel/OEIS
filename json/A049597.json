If this is correct, we have T(n-1,k-1) = sum_{j<=min(k,n-k-2)} (k-j) * T(k-1,j-1) with T(n-1,n-1) = n. Equivalently, T(n-1,k-1) = T(n-2,k-2) + sum(j<=min(k,n-k-2)} T(k-1,j-1) and thus T(n-1,k-1) = 2*T(n-2,k-2) - T(n-3,k-3) + T(k-1,n-k-3). - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 27 2008","references":["Cf.
