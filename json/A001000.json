The identity of these two sequences was first proved by Rustem Aidagulov and a detailed version of the proof can be found in the Alekseyev link below.For sets of real numbers S and T, let S be a divider of T if some element of S lies strictly between any two distinct elements of T. Let Fence(n) = {a/n : a in Z}, Recip(n) = {1/b : 1 <= b <= n} Farey(n) = {a/b : a in Z, 1 <= b <= n}. Then a(n) is the smallest k such that Fence(k) is a divider of Recip(n) and also the smallest k such that Fence(k) is a divider of Farey(n), as shown by S. Rustem Aidagulov. - _David W. Wilson_, Aug 30 2007Suppose that S is a set of 2 or more real numbers.  The least m such that for every r and s in S there is an integer k such that r < k/m < s is the first separator of S.  The least m such that for every r and s in S there exists an integer k such that r < k/m < (k+1)/m < s is the second separator of S, and so on....For example, A001000 gives first separators for the sets S(n) = {0,1/2,1/3,...,1/n}.
