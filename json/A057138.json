F. Hasler_, Jan 13 2013Comments by _Hieronymus Fischer_, Jan 23 2013 (Start):A definition which is also consistent is: Start with terms 0 and 1 and then concatenate the next digit at left hand end. If the next digit is a zero, keep this zero in mind so that the then following digit is a 1 preceding a 0.The sequence terms are the terms of A057137 in reversed digit order. Based on this understanding, the anomaly for the indices 0 and 1 where the terms are 0 and 1 instead of 0 and 10 (what one would expect) becomes self-explaining. Also, the special behavior when the zero digit is encountered becomes clear.Examples: a(3) = 321 = Reversal(A057137(3)),a(10) = 987654321 = Reversal(A057137(10)) = Reversal(1234567890).
