The deck is shuffled and dealt in to n hands with 3 cards each. A match occurs for every card in the j-th hand of kind j. A(n) is the number of ways of achieving no matches. The probability of no matches is A(n)/((3n)!/3!^n).Number of fixed-point-free permutations of n distinct letters (ABCD...), each of which appears thrice.
