Infinite square array read by antidiagonals, where T(m,n) = length of longest carry propagation when u and v are added in binary, for u >= 0, v >= 0.The array begins:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...0 1 0 2 0 1 0 3 ...0 0 1 1 0 0 2 2 ...0 2 1 1 0 3 2 2 ...0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ...0 1 0 3 1 1 1 2 ...0 0 2 2 1 1 1 1 ...0 3 2 2 1 2 1 1 ......See A192054 for definition of carry propagation.
