Hilbert gave as examples 2^sqrt(2) and e^Pi. Later in his life he expressed the view that this problem was more difficult than the problems of Riemann's hypothesis or Fermat's Last Theorem. Nevertheless, e^Pi was proved transcendental in 1929 and 2^sqrt(2) in 1930, illustrating the extreme difficulty of anticipating the future progress of mathematics and the real difficulty of any problem - until after it has been solved. - David WellsThis constant is sometimes called the Gelfond-Schneider constant. - _Paul Muljadi_, Oct 12 2008","references":["N.
