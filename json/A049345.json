A007623), since factorial(n) < n^n < primorial(n) for n > 12. However, the point where the digits become larger than 9 comes earlier: as soon as 10*7*5*3*2 = 2100 for the primorial base vs 10! = 3628800 in the factorial base. From there on, the representation using concatenation of digits written in decimal becomes ambiguous. - _M. F.
