It is divisible by 8,40+1=41 is prime. Smaller multiples of 8 are not suitable because e.g. albeit 8|16 and 16+1=17 is a prime, but the largest power of 2 which divides 16 is not 8, it is 16. So 16 is not the 3rd, it is the 4th term here.","crossrefs":["A000040, A006093."],"keyword":"nonn","offset":"0,2","author":"_Labos Elemer_, Nov 02 2000","extensions":["More terms from Larry Reeves (larryr(AT)acm.org), Nov 03 2000"]}
