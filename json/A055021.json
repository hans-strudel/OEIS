So A107914 (four recursive steps) contains only odd squares. Assume p prime so sigma(p^2) = p^2 + p + 1 = m^2 never meets the condition with p+2k=m that (p+2k)^2 = m^2. This implies the impossibility of a solution for numbers of the form p^(2i) and numbers of the form p^(2i)q^(2i). - Lambert Klasen (Lambert.Klasen(AT)gmx.net), Jun 06 2005","example":"sigma(sigma(sigma(9)))=24 >= 2*9, so a(3)=9.","crossrefs":["Cf.
