Here is a method for generating such permutations. Start with two lists, the first has numbers 1 to n, while the second is empty.\"Repeat the following operations until the first list is empty: 1. Move the largest number of the first list to the leftmost available position in the second list. The move operation removes the original number from the first list. 2. Move the largest number of the first list to the rightmost available position in the second list.\"3. Move the smallest number of the first list to the leftmost available position in the second list. 4. Move the smallest number of the first list to the rightmost available position in the second list. For example when n=8, the permutation is 8, 1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2, 7.\" (End)","links":["<a href=\"/index/Rec#order_05\">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (3,-2,-2,3,-1)."],"formula":"(1/12) [2n^3 + 4n - 3 + 3(-1)^n ]. - _Ralf Stephan_, Jan 30 2005f(n) = (2n^3 + 4n - 3 + 3(-1)^n)/12. - _Ralf Stephan_, Jan 31 2005.a(2)=2, a(3)=5, a(4)=12, a(5)=22, a(6)=38, a(n)=3*a(n-1)-2*a(n-2)- 2*a(n-3)+ 3*a(n-4)-a(n-5). - _Harvey P.
