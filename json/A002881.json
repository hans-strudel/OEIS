If no two of these squares have the same size the squared rectangle is perfect. A squared rectangle is simple if it does not contain a smaller squared rectangle. The order of a squared rectangle is the number of constituent squares. [_Geoffrey H. Morley_, Oct 17 2012]","references":["C. J. Bouwkamp, personal communication.","N. J. A.
