It is either 6 or 7 depending on whether the word used is 'zeroth' or 'noughth'. - _Jon Perry_, Nov 01 2014The ordinal numbers 101st, 102nd, etc., are commonly spoken as \"one hundred and first,\" \"one hundred and second,\" etc., with the word \"and\" following the word \"hundred.\" The more concise wordings \"one hundred first,\" \"one hundred second,\" etc. (without the word \"and\") are recommended by numerous authoritative reference works on American English, including the AP Style Guide and the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual. The American convention of omitting the \"and\" is followed in the b-file. - _Jon E.
