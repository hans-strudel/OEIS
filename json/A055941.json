The number of fields that can be freely chosen while still satisfying (0), (1) and (2) is a(n), where n is the diagonal, read as a binary number with least significant bit at upper left.a(n) is also the minimum number of adjacent bit swap operations required to pack all the ones of n to the right. - _Philippe Beaudoin_, Aug 19 2014","references":["A.
