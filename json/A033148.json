He also proved that in the latter case, a(n) is a multiple of 2^k. He found all solutions when n was less than 20.Kraitchik carried the calculations further (for n less than 28). In his book he tabulated only the values a(n)/2^k. He had correct entries for n=21 and n=25, but his values for n=20 and n=24 were 1 too small -- of course he had calculated everything by hand!
