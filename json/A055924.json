To see this, recall that stirling1(n, k) is the number of permutations of [n]={1,...,n} with k cycles and bell(k) is the number of set partitions of [k].Given such a permutation and set partition, write the permutation in standard cycle form (smallest entry first in each cycle and first entries decreasing left to right). For example, with n=15 and k=6, {{10}, {6, 11}, {5, 7, 15}, {3, 13, 12, 8}, {2, 14, 9}, {1, 4}} is in this standard cycle form.Then combine cycles as specified by the partition to form a set of lists. For example, the partition 156-24-3 would yield {{10, 2, 14, 9, 1, 4}, {6, 11, 3, 13, 12, 8}, {5, 7, 15}}. The original first entries are now the record left-to-right lows.Finally, apply to each list the well known transformation that sends # record lows to # cycles. The example yields {{4, 14, 1, 2, 10, 9}, {13, 11, 3, 6, 8, 12}, {7, 15, 5}}. This is a bijection to sets of lists (i.e. permutations) with a total of k cycles, as required.
