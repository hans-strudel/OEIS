To produce Pi the above continued fraction is used. It is formed by n^2/(2*n+1) which starts at n=1. Most numerators of continued fractions are 1 & thus are left out of the brackets. In the case of pi they vary. Therefore here both numerators & denominators are given. The first 4 convergents are 1/3,5/19,44/160,476/1744.
