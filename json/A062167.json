{"formerly":"","seq":"1,0,0,1,2,3,5,29,93,569,3226,28630,221250,2314650","description":"Number of permutations with at most 2 queens on any torus diagonal, solutions congruent on the torus count only once.","comments":"This sequence counts classes of \"near n-queens solutions\". Permutations with at most 1 queen on any torus diagonal are exactly the torus n queen solutions (A007705), those with at most 2 contain the normal n queen solutions (A000170).Therefore they may be called \"near n-queens solutions\". In this sequence, permutations p and q are considered equivalent iff there are natural x and y, such that, for all k from {0, ..., n-1}, q (k + x mod n) = p (k) + y mod n, or q is a rotation or a reflection of such a q. In other words, rotations, reflections and torus shifts are allowed. The sequence contains the objects of A062164.","links":["M.
