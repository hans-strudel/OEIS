It is generated by any k linearly independent (non-identity) elements, so the automorphism group has size (n-1)(n-2)(n-4)...(n-2^(k-1)), which grows as n^log n. I think one can show that this is optimal for n=2^k and furthermore that this has the highest rate of growth for any infinite sequence of n's. - _Michael Kleber_, Feb 21 2001Equals A061350(n) for n in A056867. - _Eric M.
