For the actual arithmetic progressions see A133277.One may also minimize the common difference: this leads to A033189, A033188 and A113872.One may also specify that the first term is the n-th prime and then minimize the common difference (or, equally, the last term): this leads to A088430 and A113834.One may also ask for n consecutive primes in arithmetic progression: this gives A006560.","references":["H.
