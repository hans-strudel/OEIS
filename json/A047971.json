The first few values are: [3,3]_q = 1; [4,3]_q = 1 + q + q^2 + q^3; [5,3]_q = 1 + q + 2q^2 + 2q^3 + 2q^4 + q^5 + q^6. - _Peter Bala_, Sep 23 2007The entry a(p,w), p >= 0, w = 0,1,...,3*p, of this irregular triangle is the number of nonnegative solutions of m_0 + m_1 + m_2 + m_3 = p and 1*m_1 + 2*m_2 + 3*m_3 = w. See the Hawkins reference given in A008967, p. 264, (4,7),(4.8), concerning Cayley's counting problem.  N(p,3,w) there equals a(p,w). The o.g.f. has been given in the formula section by Peter Bala.  See also the Cayley reference given in A008967, p. 110, 35. with m = 3, Theta = p and q = w. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 02 2012The entry a(p,w) p >= 0, w = 0,1,...,3*p, of this array gives the number of partitions of w into at most p parts, each at most 3. This follows from the preceding comment with the two Diophantine equations. From Andrews, p. 33 and p. 35, a(p,w) (called there p(N,M,n) with N=p, M=3, n=w) gives also the number of partitions of w into at most 3 parts, each at most p. This is in accordance with the symmetry of the q-binomials [p+3,p] = [p+3,3]. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 04  2012","references":["G. E.
