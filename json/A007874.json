Hence an upper bound for a(n) is the number of compositions of n into floor(n/2) parts, which is A127040(n-2). To find a(n), the length of A052558(n-2) paths must be computed. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 13 2007","example":"Consider n=4. Label the points on the circle A,B,C and D. Suppose that AB has unit length. Then a(4)=2 because the two 4-gons are ABCDA and ACBDA, with perimeters 4 and 2+2*sqrt(2), respectively.","crossrefs":["Cf. A030077."],"keyword":"nonn","offset":"1,4","author":"Peter H.
