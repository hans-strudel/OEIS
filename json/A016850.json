We observe in fact that p=3n because 25=3^2+4^2. The sequence without 0 is linked with the first nontrivial solution (trivial: n^2=0^2+n^2) of the equation X^2=2Y^2+2n^2 where X=2*k and Y=2*p+n which is equivalent to k^2=p^2+(p+n)^2 for n given. The second such \"square-sequence\" is (29*n)^2 (n>0) because 29^2=20^2+21^2 and with this relation we obtain (29*n)^2=(20*n)^2+(20n+n)^2. - _Richard Choulet_, Dec 23 2007","links":["Vincenzo Librandi, <a href=\"/A016850/b016850.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..800</a>"],"formula":"a(n) = 25*n^2 = 25*A000290(n) = 5*A033429(n). - _Omar E.
