Other values of m and p also converge but not necessarily to 1. For m =2 and p=1 we have the count of steps for the x+1 problem. m=prime and p=m+1 usually converge to 1 but break down for certain values of n. E.g. 17 locks at n=34, 23 at n=49 29 at n=91. I verified m=7 for n up to 100000. 100000 requires 157 steps to reach 1.","links":["Cino Hilliard, <a href=\"http://groups.msn.com/BC2LCC/page.msnw?fc_p=%2Fkx%2Bp%20problems&amp;fc_a=0\">The x+1 conjecture</a>"],"example":"x = 1. step1:x=1+3-1=3 step2: x=3/3=1.
