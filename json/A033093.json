The lim inf grows quite slowly: e.g. a(2047)=7. Weaker conjecture: 2, 3 and 7 are the only n for which a(n) = 1. Note that a(n)=1 implies n=2 or n=2^k-1; probabilistically, the chance that 2^k-1 has no zeros just in base 3 is C^k, where C = (2/3)^(log(2)/log(3)) ~ .774, so the number of exceptions should be finite. It appears that 2^15-1 is the last n with no zeros in either base 2 or 3 (and it does have zeros in base 5). - _Franklin T.
