This is the number of positions that can be reached in n moves from the start, but which cannot be reached in fewer than n moves. A puzzle in the Rubik cube family. The total number of distinct positions is 4096. Here positions differing by rotations or reflections are considered distinct.If the sequence is extended by trailing zeros, its binomial transform yields A010965. - _R. J.
