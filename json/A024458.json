For the definition of half-convolution see a comment on A201204, where also the rule to find the o.g.f. is given. Here the o.g.f. is obtained from (U(x)^2 + U2(x^2))/2 with U(x)=1/(1-x-x^2),the o.g.f. of A000045(n+1), n>=0, and U2(x):=(1-x)/((1+x)*(1-3*x+x^2) the o.g.f. of A007598(n+1), n>=0. This coincides with the o.g.f. given below in the formula section after x has been divided.For the bisection of this half-convolution see A027991(n+1) and A001870(n), n>=0.(End)","formula":"G.f.: x(x^3-x^2+1)/[(1+x^2)(1+x-x^2)(1-x-x^2)^2].","keyword":"nonn","offset":"1,3","author":"_Clark Kimberling_","extensions":["More terms from _James A.
