Can someone prove this sequence is finite and full? - _Olivier Gérard_, Jun 26 2001To prove that 127 is the last prime, we need to show that prime gaps satisfy prime(k)-prime(k-1)<sqrt(prime(k-1)) for k>31. Although it is easy to verify this inequality for all known prime gaps, there is no proof for all gaps. - _T. D.

This squared is 9, which when divided by the previous prime 2 leaves remainder 1, which is odd. So 3 is in the sequence. 11 is not in the sequence because 11^2, when divided by the previous prime 7, leaves a remainder of 121 (mod 7) = 2, which is even.","mathematica":"Prime /@ Select[ Range[ 2, 100 ], OddQ[ Mod[ Prime[ # ]^2, Prime[ # - 1 ] ] ] & ]Transpose[Select[Partition[Prime[Range[50]],2,1],OddQ[PowerMod[Last[#],2, First[#]]]&]] [[2]]  (* _Harvey P.
