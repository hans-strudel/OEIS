These are also known as Generalized Retarded Functions.The numbers up to d=6 were first produced by T. S. Evans using a Pascal program, strictly as upper bounds only.  M. van Eijck wrote a C program using a direct enumeration of hyperplanes which confirmed these and produced the value for d=7. Kamiya et al. showed how to find these numbers and some associated polynomials using more sophisticated methods, giving results up to d=7. T. S. Evans added the last number on Aug 01 2011 using an updated version of van Eijck's program, which took 7 days on a standard desktop computer.","references":["T. S.
