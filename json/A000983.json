Weisstein_, Feb 20 2016For k > 0, a(2^k-1) = 2^(2^k-k-1). In this case the minimal covering code is also a Hamming code.In the game described at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_Puzzle#Hamming_Codes, with n players, the optimal strategy wins with probability 1-a(n)/2^n. In the optimal strategy, the players first agree on a minimal covering code of length n. After the hats are placed, each player knows two words of length n such that one of them is the hat colors of the n players. If one of these two words is a member of the covering code and the other word is not, that player guesses the word that is not. Otherwise, that player does not guess. This strategy guarantees that the team wins for all words that are not members of the covering code.Because each codeword covers n+1 of the 2^n words, A053637(n+1) is a lower bound. - _Rob Pratt_, Jan 05 2015","references":["G.
