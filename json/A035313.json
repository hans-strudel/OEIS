Wilson_, Feb 26 2012Conjecturally, every positive integer occurs in the sequence or one of its n-th differences, which would imply that the sequence and its n-th differences partition the positive integers. - _David W. Wilson_, Feb 26 2012Conjecture: lim(n->infinity, a(n+1)/a(n)) = 2. - _David W. Wilson_, Feb 26 2012Note that the n-th differences yield the n-th subdiagonals (parallels to the right edge) in the triangle A035312. Therefore Lallouet's statement and Wilson's 1st comment above are just rephrasing the definition of that triangle.  - _M. F.
