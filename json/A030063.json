{"formerly":"","seq":"0,1,3,8,120","description":"Fermat's Diophantine m-tuple: 1 + the product of any two distinct terms is a square.","comments":"Baker and Davenport proved that no other positive integer can replace 120 and still preserve the property that 1 + the product of any two distinct terms is a square. In particular, the sequence cannot be extended to another integer term. However, it can be extended to another rational term - see A192629. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Jul 11 2011It is conjectured that there do not exist five strictly positive integers with the property that 1 + the product of any two distinct terms is a square. (See Dujella's links.) - _Jonathan Sondow_, Apr 04 2013Other such quadruples can be generated using the formula F(2n), F(2n + 2), F(2n + 4) and F(2n + 1)F(2n + 2)F(2n + 3) given in Koshy's book. - _Alonso del Arte_, Jan 18 2011Other such quadruples are generated by Euler's formula a, b, a+b+2*r, 4*r*(r+a)*(r+b), where 1+a*b = r^2.","references":["M.
