It divides the square into two pieces. Call these pieces monarcs. Polyarcs are the figures created by joining monarcs edge-to-edge. - _Henri Picciotto_, Jan 04 2015Henri Picciotto invented and named the polyarcs in the late 1980’s. They were first published in World Games Review, Michael Keller’s zine. Brendan Owen found and counted the polyarcs to n = 9. - _N. J. A.
