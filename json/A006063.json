However, this is incorrect: see A096680 for n values with more than one such permutation. (Ray Chandler)For any n, the number of permutations is permanent(m), where the n-by-n matrix m is defined m(i,j) = 1 or 0, depending on whether i+j is a cube or not. Hence, n is in this sequence if permanent(m) > 0.","references":["M. Gardner, Mathematical Games column, Scientific American, Mar 1975.","M. Gardner, Time Travel and Other Mathematical Bewilderments.
