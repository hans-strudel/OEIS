They thus became metrological reference points, no longer subject to experimental assessment. These should not be confused with \"conventional\" values of some empirical quantities (such as Josephsonâ€™s constant) used in applied metrology, but not assigned, and therefore subject to possible future revisions.Assigned metrological constants and some of their combinations that appear in the OEIS include the speed of light (this sequence) and its square, cube, and 4th power (A182999, A183000, and A183001, respectively); magnetic permeability of vacuum (A019694); electric permittivity of vacuum (A081799); characteristic impedance of vacuum (A213610); standard gravity acceleration (A072915), standard atmosphere (A213611), Julian year (A213612), Gregorian year (A213613) and the light-year (A213614), all in basic SI units.(End)Prime factors of this number are: 2^1, 7^1, 73^1, 293339^1. - _John W.
