This is the rewritten so-called trace of the transfer matrix formula for the T-polynomials. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 02 2010In a regular N-gon, inscribed in a unit circle, the side length is d(N,1)=2*sin(Pi/N). The length ratio R(N,k):=d(N,k)/d(N,1) for the (k-1)-th diagonal, with k from {2,3,...,floor(N/2)}, N>=4, equals S(k-1,x)= sin(k*Pi/N)/sin(Pi/N) with x=rho(N):=R(N,2)= 2*cos(Pi/N). Example: N=7 (heptagon),rho=R(7,2), sigma:=R(N,3)= S(2,rho)= rho^2-1. Motivated by the quoted paper by P. Steinbach. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 02 2010From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jul 12 2011: (Start)In q- or basic analysis q-numbers are [n]_q :=S(n-1,q+1/q) = (q^n-(1/q)^n})/(q-1/q), with the row polynomials S(n,x), n>=0.The zeros of the row polynomials S(n-1,x) are (from those of Chebyshev U-polynomials):  x(n-1;k) = +/- t(k,rho(n)), k=1,...,ceiling((n-1)/2), n>=2, with t(n,x) the row polynomials of A127672 and rho(n):= 2*cos(Pi/n). The simple vanishing zero for even n appears here as +0 and -0.Factorization of the row polynomials S(n-1,x), x>=1, in terms of the minimal polynomials of cos(2 pi/2), called Psi(n,x), with coefficients given by A181875/A181876:  S(n-1,x) = (2^(n-1))*product(Psi(d,x/2), 2 < d | 2n), n>=1.  (From the rewritten eq. (3) of the Watkins and Zeitlin reference, given under A181872.)  (End)The discriminants of the S(n,x) polynomials are found in A127670. [_Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 03 2011]This is an example for a subclass of Riordan convolution arrays (lower triangular matrices) called Bell arrays. See the L. W. Shapiro et al. reference under A007318. If a Riordan array is named (G(z),F(z)) with F(z)=z*Fhat(z), the o.g.f. for the row polynomials is G(z)/(1-x*z*Fhat(z)), and it becomes a Bell array if G(z)=Fhat(z). For the present Bell type triangle  G(z)=1/(1+z^2) (see the o.g.f. comment above). This leads to the o.g.f. for the column no. k, k>=0, x^k/(1+x^2)^(k+1) (see the formula section), the one for the row sums and for the alternating row sums (see comments above). The Riordan (Bell) A- and Z-sequences (defined in a W.Lang link under A006232, with references) have o.g.f.s 1-x*c(x^2) and -x*c(x^2), with the o.g.f. of the Catalan numbers A000108. Together they lead to a recurrence given in the formula section. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Nov 04 2011The determinant of the N x N matrix S(N,[x[1], ...., x[N]]) with elements S(m-1,x[n]), for n, m = 1, 2, ..., N, and for any x[n], is identical with the determinant of V(N,[x[1], ...., x[N]]) with elements x[n]^(m-1) (a Vandermondian, which equals product(x[j] - x[i], 1 <= i < j<= N)). This is a special instance of a theorem valid for any N >= 1 and any monic polynomial system p(m,x), m>=0 , with p(0,x) = 1. For this theorem see the Vein-Dale reference, p. 59. Thanks to L. Edson Jeffery for an email asking for a proof of the non-singularity of the matrix S(N,[x[1], ...., x[N]]) if and only if the x[j], j = 1..N, are pairwise different. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 26 2013These S polynomials also appear in the context of modular forms. The rescaled Hecke operator T*_n = n^((1-k)/2)*T_n acting on modular forms of weight k satisfies T*_(p^n) = S(n, T*_p), for each prime p and positive integer n. See the Koecher-Krieg reference, p. 223. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 22 2016For a shifted o.g.f. (mod signs), its compositional inverse, and connections to Motzkin and Fibonacci polynomials, non-crossing partitions and other combinatorial structures, see A097610. - _Tom Copeland_, Jan 23 2016From _M. Sinan Kul_, Jan 30 2016: (Start)Solutions of the Diophantine equation u^2 + v^2 - k*u*v = 1 for integer k given by (u(k,n), v(k,n)) = (S(n,k), S(n-1,k)) because of the Cassini-Simson identity: S(n,x)^2 - S(n+1,x)*S(n-1, x) = 1, after use of the S-recurrence. Note that S(-n, x) = -S(-n-2, x), n >= 1, and the periodicity of some S(n, k) sequences.Hence another way to obtain the row polynomials would be to take powers of the matrix [x, -1; 1,0]: S(n, x) = ([x, -1; 1, 0])^n)[1,1], n >= 0.See also a Feb 01 2016 comment on A115139 for a well known S(n, x) sum formula.Then we have with the present T triangle  A039834(n) = -i^(n+1)*T(n-1, k) where i is the imaginary unit and n >= 0.  A051286(n) = Sum_{i=0..n}(T(n, i))^2 (see the  _Philippe DelÃ©ham_, Nov 21 2005 formula),  A181545(n) = Sum_{i=0..n+1}abs(T(n, i)^3),  A181546(n) = Sum_{i=0..n+1}(T(n, i)^4,  A181547(n) = Sum_{i=0..n+1}abs(T(n ,i)^5).S(n ,0) = A056594(n), and for k = 1..10 the sequences S(n-1, k) with offset n = 0 are A128834, A001477, A001906, A001353, A004254, A001109, A004187, A001090, A018913, A004189.(End)For more on the Diophantine equation presented by Kul, see the Ismail paper. - _Tom Copeland_, Jan 31 2016The o.g.f. for the Legendre polynomials L(n,x) is 1 / sqrt(1- 2x*z + z^2), and squaring it gives the o.g.f. of U(n,x), A053117, so Sum_{k=0..n} L(k,x/2) L(n-k,x/2) = S(n,x). This gives S(n,x) = L(n/2,x/2)^2 + 2*Sum_{k=0...n/2-1} L(k,x/2) L(n-k,x/2) for n even and S(n,x) = 2*Sum_{k=0..(n-1)/2} L(k,x/2) L(n-k.x/2) for odd n.

Proof: Use the trace formula 2*T(n, x/2) = S(n, x) - S(n-2, x) (see the Dec 02 2010 comment above) and the S-recurrence several times.
