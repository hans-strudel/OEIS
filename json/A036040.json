(See, e.g., [Coffey] and program below.)The complete Bell polynomial of the first n primes gives A007446.(End)A relation between partition polynomials formed from these \"refined\" Stirling numbers of the second kind and umbral operator trees and Lagrange inversion is presented in the link \"Lagrange a la Lah\".For simple diagrams of the relation between connected graphs, cumulants, and A036040 see the references on statistical physics below.
