Proof: Assume that there exists such n > 1. Consider its smallest prime divisor p. Then 2^n == 1 (mod p) implying that the multiplicative order ord_p(2) divides n. However, since ord_p(2) < p and p is the smallest divisor of n, we have ord_p(2) = 1, that is, p divides 2^1 - 1 = 1 which is impossible. - _Max Alekseyev__Labos Elemer_ asked on Sep 27 2001 if all numbers > 1 eventually appear in A015910, that is, if a(n) > 0 for n > 1.Obviously, k > n. - _Daniel Forgues_, Jul 06 2015","references":["P.
