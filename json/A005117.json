Squarefree numbers (A005117) has D(n)=1, other numbers are \"deviated\" from the squarefree ideal and have 0<D(n)<1. For D(n)=1/2 we have A048109, for D(n)=3/4 we have A067295. - _Ctibor O.

The levels are the prime numbers prime(j), j >= 1, and the occupation numbers (exponents) e(j) are 0 or 1 (like in Pauli's exclusion principle). A 'fermionic state' is then denoted by a sequence with entries 0 or 1, where, except for the zero sequence, trailing zeros are omitted. The zero sequence stands for a(1) = 1. For example a(5) = 6 = 2^1*3^1 is denoted by the 'fermionic state' [1, 1], a(7) = 10 by [1, 0, 1]. Compare with 'fermionic partitions' counted in A000009. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, May 14 2014Numbers whose sum of divisors is equal to the sum of unitary divisors: A000203(a(n)) = A034448(a(n)). - _Paolo P. Lava_, Oct 08 2014From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Nov 20 2014: (Start)The following is an Eratosthenes-type sieve for squarefree numbers. For integers > 1:1) Remove even numbers, except for 2; the minimal non-removed number is 3.2) Replace multiples of 3 removed in step 1, and remove multiples of 3 except for 3 itself; the minimal non-removed number is 5.3) Replace multiples of 5 removed as a result of steps 1 and 2, and remove multiples of 5 except for 5 itself; the minimal non-removed number is 6.4) Replace multiples of 6 removed as a result of steps 1, 2 and 3 and remove multiples of 6 except for 6 itself; the minimal non-removed number is 7.5) Repeat using the last minimal non-removed number to sieve from the recovered multiples of previous steps.Proof. We use induction. Suppose that as a result of the algorithm, we have found all squarefree numbers less than n and no other numbers. If n is squarefree, then the number of its proper divisors d>1 is even (it is 2^k - 2, where k is the number of its prime divisors), and, by the algorithm, it remains in the sequence.  Otherwise, n is removed, since the number of its squarefree divisors >1 is odd (it is 2^k-1).(End)The lexicographically least sequence of integers > 1 such that each entry has an even number of proper divisors occurring in the sequence (that's the sieve restated). - _Glen Whitney_, Aug 30 20150 is nonsquarefree because it is divisible by any square. - _Jon Perry_, Nov 22 2014, edited by _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 13 2015The Heinz numbers of partitions with distinct parts. We define the Heinz number of a partition p = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_r] as Product(p_j-th prime, j=1...r) (concept used by Alois P. Heinz in A215366 as an \"encoding\" of a partition). For example, for the partition [1, 1, 2, 4, 10] the Heinz number is 2*2*3*7*29 = 2436. The number 30 (= 2*3*5) is in the sequence because it is the Heinz number of the partition [1,2,3]. - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 21 2015It is possible for 2 consecutive terms to be even; for example a(258)=422 and a(259)=426. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Jul 21 2015. - These form a subsequence of A077395 since their product is divisible by 4. - _M.
