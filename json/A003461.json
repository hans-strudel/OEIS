The relationship was first pointed out by Johann Titius in 1766 and was formulated as a mathematical expression by J. E. Bode in 1778. It lead Bode to predict the existence of another planet between Mars and Jupiter in what is now called the asteroid belt. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Mar 19 2008","references":["S. L.
