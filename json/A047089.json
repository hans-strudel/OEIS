Chow (tchow(AT)alum.mit.edu}, Nov 15 2006 on this sequence and A107027. \"If you replace \"the line y = x/2\" with \"the line y = x/(n-1)\" in the definition of this sequence, then the formula for T(h,k) becomes (h+k choose k) - (n-1)*(h+k choose k-1).\"As for A107027, it has a combinatorial interpretation: T(n,k) is the number of paths of length n*k such that each step has length 1 directed up or right and touches the line y = x/(n-1) only at lattice points.\"To see this, let us avoid notational confusion by replacing the \"k\" in A047089 by \"j\". Then the formula above becomes (h+j choose j) - (n-1)*(h+j choose j-1).\"If we sum over all the points at a distance n*k from (0,0) - i.e. if we sum from j=0 to j=k and let h = n*k-j - then we get (n*k choose k) - (n-2) * sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (n*k choose j) This is equivalent to the formula you report for A107027.\"","example":"Diagonals (beginning on row 0): {1}; {1,1}; {1,1,1}; {1,2,2,1};...","prog":"(PARI) {T(n, k) = local(v); if( k<0 || k>n, 0, for(i=1, n+1, v=vector(i, j, if( j<2 || j>i-1, 1, v[j-1] + if( i%3 || i!=j+i\\3, v[j])))); v[k+1])}; /* _Michael Somos_, Jan 28 2004 */(PARI) {T(n, k) = if( k<0 || k>n, 0, if( n==0 && k==0, 1, T(n-1, k-1) + if( (n+1)%3 || n!=k+(n+1)\\3, T(n-1, k))))}; /* _Michael Somos_, Jan 28 2004 */","crossrefs":["See also the related array A107027."],"keyword":"nonn,tabl","offset":"0,8","author":"_Clark Kimberling_","extensions":["\"Diagonals\" in definition changed to \"antidiagonals\" by _Michael Somos_, Aug 19 2007"]}
