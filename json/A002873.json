There are also one such partition with just one part, two with three parts, and one with four parts; but three is the largest of these amounts. Thus, a(2) = 3.Similarly, there are ten (1,2)(3,4)(5,6) invariant partitions of {1,2,3,4,5,6} into three non-empty parts, and no larger amount into any other given number of parts, whence a(3) = 10.","crossrefs":["Cf.
