It is also various other 'partial columns' and 'partial diagonals'.To calculate the i-th column / j-th row value, one can work backwards to find which column of the first row it came from. For each row, first reverse its position within the group then go up. It appears lim n->infinity a(n)/n^2 exists and is ~ .22847 ~ sqrt(.0522) (end)","references":["N. J. A.
