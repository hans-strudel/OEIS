Taking all the levels together to create a pyramid, one face would be A010054 as a triangle with a parallel face which is Pascal's triangle (A007318) with two columns removed, another face would be a triangle of Stirling numbers of the second kind (A008277) and a third face would be A000007 as a triangle, with a triangle of Eulerian numbers (A008292), A062253, A062254 and A062255 as faces parallel to it.
