They are Sheffer polynomials satisfying the binomial convolution identity s(n,x+y) = sum(binomial(n,k)*s(k,x)*p(n-k,y),k=0..n), with polynomials p(n,x)=sum(|A008297(n,m)|*(-x)^m, m=1..n), n >= 1 and p(0,x)=1 (for Sheffer polynomials see A048854 for S. Roman reference).These polynomials appear in the radial part of the l=1 (p-wave) eigen functions for the discrete energy levels of the H-atom. See Messiah reference.The unsigned version of this triangle is the triangle of unsigned 2-restricted Lah numbers A143497. - _Peter Bala_, Aug 25 2008This matrix (unsigned) is embedded in that for n!*L(n,-3,-x). Introduce 0,0,0 to each unsigned row and then add 1,-2,1,4,2,1 to the beginning of the array as the first three rows to generate n!*L(n,-3,-x). - _Tom Copeland_, Apr 21 2014From - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jul 07 2014 (Start)The standard Rodrigues formula for the monic generalized Laguerre polynomials (also called Laguerre-Sonin polynomials) is Lm(n,alpha,x) := (-1)^n*n!*L(n,3,x) is x^(-alpha)*exp(x)*(d/dx)^n(exp(-x)*x^(n+alpha)). Another Rodrigues type formula is Lm(n,alpha,x) = exp(x)*x^(-alpha+n+1)*(-x^2*d/dx)^n*(exp(-x)*x^(alpha+1)). This is derivable from the differential - difference relation of Lm(n,alpha,x) which yields first the creation operator formula -(x*d/dx + (-x + alpha + n + 1))*Lm(n,alpha,x) = Lm(n+1,alpha,x) or in the variable q = log(x) the operator -(d/dq + alpha + n + 1 - exp(q)). The identity (due to Christoph Mayer) (d/dq - diff(W(q),q))*f(q) = exp(W(q)*d/dq(exp(-W(q)*f(q)) is then iterated with W(q) = W(alpha,n,q) = exp(q) - (alpha + n + 1)*q and a further change of variables leads then to the given result.
