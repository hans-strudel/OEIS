This triangle has approximate internal angles 25.588 degs, 42.941 degs, 111.471 degs. [_Frank M Jackson_, Jun 15 2011]When a cylinder is completely enclosed by a sphere, it occupies a fraction f of the sphere volume. The value of f has a trivial lower bound of 0, and an upper bound which is this constant. It is achieved iff the cylinder diameter is sqrt(2) times its height, and the sphere is circumscribed to it. A similar constant can be associated with any n-dimensional geometric shape. For 3D cuboids it is A165952. - _Stanislav Sykora_, Mar 07 2016","links":["Ivan Panchenko, <a href=\"/A020760/b020760.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..1000</a>"],"formula":"Equals 1/A002194. - _Michel Marcus_, Oct 12 2014Equals cosine of the magic angle: cos(A195696). - _Stanislav Sykora_, Mar 07 2016Equals square root of A010701. - _Michel Marcus_, Mar 07 2016","example":"1/sqrt(3) = 0.577350269189625764509148780501957455647601751270126876018602326...
