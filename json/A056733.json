This is an odd fact, very suitable for puzzle columns and likely to amuse amateurs, but there is nothing in it which appeals much to a mathematician. The proof is neither difficult nor interesting--merely a little tiresome. The theorem is not serious; and it is plain that one reason (though perhaps not the most important) is the extreme speciality of both the enunciation and the proof, which is not capable of any significant generalization.\" -- G.
