Arrange solutions by increasing values of z. Sequence gives values of x.","comments":"Comments from Fred W. Helenius (fredh(AT)ix.netcom.com), Jul 22 2008: (Start)There is an infinite family of solutions to c^3+1=a^3+b^3 given by(a,b,c) = (9n^3 + 1, 9n^4, 9n^4 + 3n). The present sequence actually asks aboutx^3+y^3=z^3-1 with x < y < z; for that we can take(x,y,z) = (9n^3 - 1, 9n^4 - 3n, 9n^4) for n > 1.I extracted these solutions from Theorem 235 in Hardy & Wright; theresult shown there is that all nontrivial rational solutions ofx^3 + y^3 = u^3 + v^3 are given byx = r(1 - (a - 3b)(a^2 + 3b^2))y = r((a + 3b)(a^2 + 3b^2) - 1)u = r((a + 3b) - (a^2 + 3b^2)^2)v = r((a^2 + 3b^2)^2 - (a - 3b))where r,a,b are rational and r is not zero.Specializing to r = 1, b = n/2 and a = 3n/2 givesx = 1, y = 9n^3 - 1, u = 3n - 9n^4, v = 9n^4.The solutions given above are obtained by changing signs and movingcubes from one side of the equation to the other as necessary.Unfortunately, not all integral solutions are found so easily: thethird value in A050788 corresponds to 135^3 + 138^3 = 172^3 - 1;this is not produced by such simple choices of r,a,b.
