The following equivalences hold for n > 1: There is a prime p such that n is a solution mod p of x^2 = 2 iff n^2-2 has a prime factor > n; n is a solution mod p of x^2 = 2 iff p is a prime factor of n^2-2 and p > n. n^2-2 has at most one prime factor > n, consequently such a factor is the only prime p such that n is a solution mod p of x^2 = 2.
