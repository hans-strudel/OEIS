[_Reinhard Zumkeller_, Dec 05 2009]Write w(n)=A004641 for n>=1. Each w(n) is generated by w(i) for exactly one i<=n; let g(n)=i. Each w(i) generates a single 1, in a word (10 or 100) that starts with 1. Therefore, g(n)=(number of 1s among w(1),...w(n)), so that g=A088462. That is, A004641 is generated by its partial sums.
