Porter_, Jul 05 2013Because sigma and phi are multiplicative functions, it is easy to show that (1) if a(n)=0, then n is prime or 1 and (2) if a(n)=2, then n is the product of two distinct prime numbers. Note that a(n) is the n-th term of the Dirichlet series whose generating function is given below. Using the generating function, it is theoretically possible to compute a(n). Hence a(n)=0 could be used as a primality test and a(n)=2 could be used as a test for membership in P2 (A006881). - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 01 2002It appears that a(n) - A002033(n) = zeta(s-1) * (zeta(s) - 2 + 1/zeta(s)) + 1/(zeta(s)-2). - _Eric Desbiaux_, Jul 04 2013","links":["T. D.
