This means a given term's digits must be in this order: 8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 7, 6, 3, 2, 0. It's easy to see that any n-digit term (with digits in this order) with distinct digits, none zero, occurs exactly n! times in the sequence.Since 0 = \"zero\" is sorted last, this works well for the English language. But the same cannot be \"coded without loss\" on OEIS for languages where the name for 0 is not sorted last: E.g., in German, 0=\"null\" comes before, e.g., 2=\"zwei\", which would yield \"02\" for 20, but leading zeros are not allowed on the OEIS. - _M.
