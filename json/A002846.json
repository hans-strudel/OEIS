A partition into k parts is joined to a partition into k+1 parts if the latter is a refinement of the former.The partition n^1 is at the left and the partition 1^n at the right. The illustration by _Olivier Gérard_ shows the posets L(2) through L(8).Then a(n) is the number of paths of length n-1 in L(n) that join n^1 to 1^n.Stated another way, a(n) is the number of maximal chains in the ranked poset L(n).
