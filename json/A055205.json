[From _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Dec 08 2009]a(n) = A056595(A000290(n)).Seems to be equal to the number of unordered pairs of coprime divisors of n. (Checked up to 2*10^14.) - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 03 2013Outline of a proof for this observation, _R. J. Mathar_, May 05 2013: (Start)i) To construct the divisors of n, write n=product_i p_i^e_i as the standard prime power decomposition, take any subset of the primes p_i (including the empty set representing the 1) and run with the associated list exponents from 0 up to their individual e_i.To construct the *nonsquare* divisors of n, ensure that one or more of the associated exponents is/are odd. (The empty set is interpreted as 1^0 with even exponent.) To construct the nonsquare divisors of n^2, the principle remains the same, although the exponents may individually range from 0 up to 2*e_i.The nonsquare divisor is therefore a nonempty product of prime powers (at least one) with odd exponents times  a (potentially empty) product of prime powers (of different primes) with even exponents.The nonsquare divisors of n^2 have exponents from 0 up to 2*e_i, but the subset of exponents in the \"even/square\" factor has e_i candidates (range 2, 4, .., 2*e_i) and in the \"odd/nonsquare\" factor also only e_i candidates (range 1,3,5,2*e_i-1).ii) To construct the pairs of coprime divisors of n, take any two non-intersecting subsets of  the set of p_i (possibly the empty subset which represents the factor 1), and let the exponents run from 1 up to their individual e_i in each of the two products.iii) The bijection between the sets constructed in i) and ii) is given by mapping the two non-intersection prime sets onto each other, and observing that the numbers of compositions of exponents have the same orders in both cases.(End)","links":["T.
