The upper bound is 7, so should a 7-colorable, simple, connected, unit-distance graph be found, the chromatic number of the plane problem will be solved. - _Matthew McAndrews_, Feb 21 2016","links":["Matthew McAndrews, <a href=\"/A059103/a059103.pdf\">Simple Connected Units Distance Graphs Through 6 Vertices</a>"],"example":"a(4)=5 because the complete graph on 4 points cannot be realized in the plane with all edges of equal length.
