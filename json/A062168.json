{"formerly":"","seq":"1,0,0,1,2,3,3,19,31,328,650,14542,37449,771570","description":"Number of permutations with at most 2 queens on any torus diagonal, solutions similar on the torus count only once.","comments":"As A062167, also this sequence counts classes of \"near n-queens solutions\". In this sequence, two permutations p and q are considered similar iff there is a factor f, 0 < f < n, satisfying GCD (f,n) = 1, such that for all k from {0, ..., n-1} q (k * f mod n) = p (k) * f mod n or if q is a rotation, a reflection or a shift of such a q. In other words, also expansions are allowed which move the queen at (k, p(k)) to (f * k mod n, f * p(k) mod n). The sequence contains the objects of A062165.","links":["M.
