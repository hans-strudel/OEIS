The palindromic part starts and ends with p_(n+1)-1 for the n-th primorial number.This sequence has period A005867(4)=A000010(A002110(4))=48. The 0th, first, 2nd and 3rd similar difference sequences are as follows: {1},{2},{4,2},{6,4,2,4,2,4,6,2} obtained from reduced residue systems of consecutive primorials.Difference sequence of the \"4th diatomic sequence\" - A. de Polignac (1849), J.
