Also used in computer science as a model of distributed behavior. It is a special case of Chip Firing Game and more generally it can be viewed as a cellular automaton.It is known that the sets SPM(n) have a lattice structure. An explicit formula is known for the (unique) fixed point of SPM(n), as well as a characterization of the elements of SPM(n).Contribution from _Roger L.
