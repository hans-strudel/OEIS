Two decks each have n kinds of cards, 3 of each kind. The first deck is laid out in order. The second deck is shuffled and laid out next to the first. A match occurs if a card from the second deck is next to a card of the same kind from the first deck. Triangle T(n,k) is the number of ways of achieving exactly k matches (k=0..3n). The probability of exactly k matches is T(n,k)/(3n)!.rows are of length 1,4,7,10,...","references":["F. N. David and D. E. Barton, Combinatorial Chance, Hafner, NY, 1962, Ch. 7 and Ch. 12.","F. F.
