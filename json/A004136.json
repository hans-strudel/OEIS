A difference set construction by Singer shows that equality holds when n-1 is a prime power. When n is a prime power, a difference set construction by Bose shows that a(n) <= n^2-1. By computation, equality holds in the latter bound at least for 7, 11 and 13.","references":["R. L. Graham and N. J. A. Sloane, On Additive Bases and Harmonious Graphs, SIAM J.
