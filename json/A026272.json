The first occurrence of n precedes the first occurrence of n+1. (cont.)Also related to the Wythoff array (A035513) and the Para-Fibonacci sequence (A035513) where every positive integer is displayed exactly once in the whole array. Take any integer n in A026272 and let C = number of terms from the beginning of the sequence to the second occurrence of n. Then C = (2nd term after n in the applicable sequence for n in A035513). (cont.)Also in the second occurrence of n in A026272, let N=n ( - one term) = (first term value after n in the applicable sequence for n in A035513). In this format the second occurrence of n in A026272 will produce in A035513, n itself and two of the succeeding terms of n in the Wythoff array where every positive integer can only be displayed once. (cont.)In A026272 if |a(n)-a(n+1)| > 10 then phi ~ a(n)/|a(n)-a(n+1)|. When n -> infinity it will converge to phi. - _Daniel Joyce_, Apr 13 2001Or, put a copy of n in A000027 n places further along! - _Zak Seidov_, May 24 2008Another version would prefix this sequence with two leading 0's (see the Angelini reference). If we use this form and write down the indices of the two 0's, the two 1's, the two 2's, the two 3's, etc., then we get A072061. - _Jacques ALARDET_, Jul 26 2008","references":["E.
