There are no arbitrarily long subsequences with a given upper bound; for example, every sequence of 4 values includes one divisible by 2 but not 4, so there are no more than 3 consecutive zeros. Similarly, there can be no more than 23 consecutive values with none divisible by both 2 and 3 but neither 4 nor 9 (so a(n) >= 2), etc. In general, this gives an upper bound that is a (relatively) small multiple of the k-th primorial number (prime(k)#). One suspects that the actual upper bounds for such subsequences are quite a bit lower; e.g., Erd≈ës conjectured that there are no three consecutive powerful numbers. - _Franklin T.
