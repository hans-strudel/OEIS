The conjecture holds for the first few terms, but then a(n) is larger than 2q-1. Phil Carmody proved a(n)>=2q-1. Terms were calculated by Weissman, Carmody and McCranie.A049300(n) is the smallest value of the mentioned consecutive integers. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jun 14 2003","references":["Dickson, L.
