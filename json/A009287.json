F. Hasler_, Sep 02 2008The calculation of a(7) and a(8) is based upon the method in A037019 (which, apparently, is the method previously used by the authors of A009287). So a(7) and a(8) are correct unless n=a(6)=5040 or n=a(7)=293318625600 are \"exceptional\" as described in A037019. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Aug 17 2006a(7) is correct because 5040 not exceptional (see A072066). - _T. D.
