Suppose the residue of the P_(n+1) to P_i is k, we can make P_(n+1) = m*P_i + k. Set l = P_(n+1) - P_n, the composite numbers in between of P_n and P_(n+1) will be consecutively m*P_i + C, where C = k-l+1, k-l+2,...,k-1. If k < l, there must be a value of C equals zero since k-1 > 0 and k-l+1 <= 0, thus makes P_i a factor of a composite number in between P_n and P_(n+1). If k >= l, all C values are greater than zero, thus P_i cannot be a factor of a composite number in between P_n and P_(n+1). (End)","links":["T. D.
