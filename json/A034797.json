A set can be considered an impartial game where the legal moves are the members. The value of an impartial game is always an ordinal (for finite games, an integer).The next term, 2^2059 + 2059, has 620 decimal digits and is too large to include. - _Olivier Gérard_, Jun 26 2001Positions of records in A103318. - _N.
