(3) \"5, 16, 5\" is also palindromic.","example":"a(8)=0 because the name of \"h\", the 8th letter of the English alphabet, is pronounced with an initial (long) \"a\" sound (plus \"ch\"). Because \"a\" is a vowel, a(8)=0. a(26)=1 because the name of \"z\", the 26th letter, is pronounced with an initial \"z\" sound (whether as z plus long-e sounds (e.g. U.S.A.) or as \"zed\" (Brit.)) and \"z\" is a consonant, denoted by 1 here.","crossrefs":["Cf.
