Proof: [W. Edwin Clark and Richard Brualdi] The maximum permanent is per A where A has all 1's except for n-1 0's on the main diagonal. By Corollary 4.4 in the Brualdi et al. reference for n >= 4 any n X n (0,1)-matrix B with per B = per A can be obtained from A by permuting rows and columns. Since there are n ways to place the single 1 on the main diagonal and then n! ways to permute the distinct rows, a(n) = n*n! if n >=4. Direct computation shows this also holds for n = 1 and 3. - _W.
