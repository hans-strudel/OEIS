(Start)This is now completely standard. Cremona's mwrank program tells us thatthis is an elliptic curve of rank 2 with generators P1=(-2,3) and P2=(4,9).We now apply the algorithm (essentially due to Tzanakis and de Weger)described in Nigel Smart's book on the algorithmic solution of Diophantineequations: using Sinnou David's bounds on linear forms in ellipticlogarithms one finds that if P is an integral point thenP=aP1+bP2 for |a| and |b| less than a huge bound B (typically 10^100, sometimesmore, I didn't do the computation here), but the main point is that Bis completely explicit. One then uses the LLL algorithm: this is crucial.A first application reduces the bound to 200, say, then a second applicationto 20 and sometimes a third to 12 (at this point it is not necessary). Thena very small search gives all the possible integer points. (End)","references":["L. J. Mordell, Diophantine Equations, Ac. Press, p. 246.","T.
