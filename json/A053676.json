Consider all integer triples (i,j,k), j >= k > 0, with Oc(i) = Oc(j)+Oc(k), ordered by increasing i; sequence gives i values.","comments":"Pollock (1850) conjectured that every number is the sum of at most 7 octahedral numbers. If true, then every octahedral number is itself the sum of at most 7 octahedral numbers: do we have the sequences for those integers that are the sum of at most k octahedral numbers for each k in the range 2<k<7 and the subsequences of the octahedral number values of those sequences? For example, the integers which are the sum of 3 positive octahedral numbers begin 3, 8, 13, 18, 21, 26, 31, 39, 44, 46; of those the first octahedral number is Oc(4) = Oc(2) + Oc(3) + Oc(3) = 6 + 19 + 19 = 44. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Oct 18 2007a(21) > 10^7. - _Donovan Johnson_, Sep 29 2010","references":["Pollock, F. \"On the Extension of the Principle of Fermat's Theorem of the Polygonal Numbers to the Higher Orders of Series Whose Ultimate Differences Are Constant.
