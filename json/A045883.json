We consider the array T(i,j) where the i-th row gives the parity trajectory of i, for example for i = 6, the infinite trajectory is 6 -> 3 -> 10 ->5 -> 16 ->8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4->2-> 1 ... and T(6,j) = [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,...,1,0,0,1,...]. Now, we consider the sum of the digits 1 of each array  T(i,j), where :a(1) = sum of the digits \"1\" of T(i,j), i = 1..2^1 and j = 1;a(2) = sum of the digits \"1\" of T(i,j), i = 1..2^2 and j = 1..2;a(3) = sum of the digits \"1\" of T(i,j), i = 1..2^3 and j = 1..3;a(n) = Sum_{i=1..2^n}[ Sum_{j=1..n} T(i,j)] = Sum_{i=1..n} A001045(n)*2^(n-i) = convolution of A001045 and A000079 (see the formula below).The number of digits \"0\" equals A113861(n) = n*2^n - a(n) because n and 2^n are the dimensions of each array.An important result is that the ratio r = A113861(n) / A045883(n) tends towards 2 when n tends towards infinity. In other words, when the array tends towards infinity, the ratio r = (number of divisions by 2) / (number of multiplications by 3) tends towards 2, even if there exists divergent trajectories. That is the problem! For each possible divergent infinite trajectory, r  < 2  even though the global ratio r is 2.Conclusion:1. For each number n with a convergent trajectory T(n,k), k = 1..infinity, or for each row of the array T(i,j), the ratio r tends towards 2 (the proof is easy because the trajectory becomes periodic from a certain index 1001001001....2. For each array of dimension n X 2^n, the radio r tends towards 2.3. If there exists a number n such that the trajectory is divergent, this trajectory is random and r tends towards a real x such that 1 < = r < = x < 2.4. In order to establish a proof of the Collatz problem from this considerations (if that is possible), it is necessary to prove that a ratio < 2 for an infinite row (or several rows) of an infinite array T(i,j) is incompatible with r = 2, the exact ratio for this array.
