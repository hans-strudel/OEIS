Review MR0297583: By a solid partition of n is meant a 3-dimensional arrangement of positive integers N(x,y,z) satisfying the conditions (i) the integer N(x,y,z) is located at the point with Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z); N(x,y,z) is defined only for certain integers x,y,z >= 0, and (ii) if N(x,y,z) is defined and 0 <= x' <= x, 0 <= y' <= y, 0 <= z' <= z then N(x,y,z) is defined and N(x',y',z') <= N(x,y,z).  A solid partition is said to correspond to an (ordinary) partition of n=n_1+n_2+...+n_t, n_k>0, if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the summands n_k and the points (x_k,y_k,z_k) for which N is defined so that n_k=N(x_k,y_k,z_k). Finally, a restricted solid partition is a solid partition such that x'<=x, y'<=y, z'<=z and N(x',y',z')=N(x,y,z) implies x'=x, y'=y, z'=z.","references":["N. J. A.
