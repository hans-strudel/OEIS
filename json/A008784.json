This conjecture is correct. - _Franklin T.

Forberg_, Mar 21 2016: (Start)For a given a(n) > 2, there are 2^k solutions to sqrt(-1) mod n, (for some k>=1), and 2^(k-1) solutions primitively representing a(n) by x^2 + y^2.Record setting values for the number of solutions (i.e., the next higher k values), occur at values for a(n) given by A006278.A224450 and A224770 give a(n) values with exactly one and exactly two solutions, respectively, primitively representing integers as x^2 + y^2.The 2^k different solutions for sqrt(-1) mod n can written as values for j, with j<=n, such that integers r = sqrt(n*j-1). However, the set of j values (listed from smallest to largest) transform into themselves symmetrically (i.e., largest to smallest) when the solutions are written as n-r. When the same 2^k solutions are written as r-j, it is clear that only 2^(k-1) distinct and independent solutions exist. (End)","references":["B. C. Berndt & R. A.
