For these n, in order for sigma(k) or sigma(n+k) to be odd, either k or n+k must be a square or twice a square. Examples: for n=7, n+k=9^2; for n=13, k=2*47^2 and for n=19, n+k=5^2. Using this idea, it is easy to show that if a(23) exists it is greater than 10^12. - _T. D. Noe_, Sep 24 2007","formula":"a(2n) = A020483(n) = A054906(n) - _T. D.
