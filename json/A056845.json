Maybe the definition of equivalence has been changed, or the rules concerning planarity or the existence of holes have changed.Comment from Larry_Reeves(AT)intranetsolutions.com, Jun 22 2001: If you look at Vicher's picture of the 40 4-celled polydiamonds (link in A056844), near the middle of the picture is a polydiamond that looks like the traditional 2-D representation of a cube with an extra diamond stuck to the edge. Depending on how you orient the cube, there are actually 2 different ways to form this polydiamond, although there is no change in the perimeter shape. I haven't confirmed that this explains the difference in values for sizes 5 and above, but it looks like a possible explanation.","links":["M.
