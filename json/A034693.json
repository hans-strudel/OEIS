I have verified this up to n = 10^6. Also, the expression 1 + n^(.74) does not work as an upper bound (counterexample: n = 19). - _Joseph L. Pe_, Jul 16 2002It is known that, for almost all n, a(n) <= n^2. From Heath-Brown's result (1992) obtained with help of the GRH, it follows that a(n) <= (phi(n)*log(n))^2. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 30 2012Conjecture: a(n) = O(log(n)*log(log(n))). - _Thomas Ordowski_, Oct 17 2014I conjecture the opposite: a(n) / (log n log log n) is unbounded.
