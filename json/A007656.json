If there is no stable isotope, choose the one with the longest decay time.Sequence is not well-defined, since the entries may change as more properties of the elements are discovered.Moss and Winter give the atomic weight for Dysprosium (Dy) as \"162.50(3)\"; rounded to 163 rather than 162.Bentor, Winter and Moss all give 145 as the atomic weight of the most stable isotope of Promethium (Pm), as opposed to 147, which was in the original data (between 144 and 150).The largest-numbered element in the sequence is now element 114, Ununquadium (Uuq), with an atomic weight of 289 for the most stable isotope.Also referred to as the mass number A of the most abundant and stable nuclide with atomic number Z=n. We have A = Z + N, where N is the neutron number A058317(n). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Oct 08 2005The 'abundance' refers to the Earth's crust. It may differ when applied to other astronomical bodies and/or to the known Universe. The mass numbers (once also referred to as the isotope numbers) are always integer, and should not be confused with relative atomic masses (or isotope masses), nor with (mean) atomic weights, none of which are ever integer. - _Stanislav Sykora_, Apr 26 2015","references":["W.

It looks to me that the rounded atomic weights were used rather than the mass number of the most abundant of the stable nuclides with atomic number equal to n. Thus for instance, a(28) should be 58, not 59 and a(29) should be 63, not 64. In fact, in all cases the parity of a(n) should be the same as n (both odd or both even). - _David Terr_, Oct 05 2006","I fixed all the entries I could find in which a(n) was incorrect, based on the online table of isotopic abundances at http://www.sisweb.com/referenc/source/exactmas.htm. - _David Terr_, Apr 06 2009","a(n) has the same parity as n for all stable elements except beryllium (n=4, a(n)=9), nitrogen (n=7, a(n)=14) and platinum (n=78, a(n)=195). - _David Terr_, Apr 07 2009","Name clarified by _Stanislav Sykora_ and _Jon E.
