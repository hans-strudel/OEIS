In the terminology of the papers referred to, it is constructed by choosing the under- lying field to be F_2(t), the element to be t and the nontrivial valuation to correspond to the polynomial 1+t. Since it counts periodic points, it satisfies the nontrivial congruence sum_{d|n}mu(d)a(n/d) = 0 mod n for all n and since it comes from a group automorphism it is a divisibility sequence.","references":["Vijay Chothi: Periodic Points in S-integer dynamical systems.
