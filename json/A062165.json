In other words, also expansions are allowed which move the queen at (k, p(k)) to (f * k mod n, f * p(k) mod n).The sequence reduces exactly the objects of A062164 and, via that sequence, these of A002562 and A000170. Note that the equivalence classes of this sequence are a subset of A062168.","links":["M.
