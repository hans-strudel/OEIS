From Geoffrey Critzer, Dec 31 2011.a(n) is the weighted sum of binary strings of length n by their number of distinct images by rotation. There is a natural correspondence between the first 2^(n-1) sequences (starting by a 0) and the 2^(n-1) starting with a 1 by inversion. There is also an internal correspondance by order inversion.
