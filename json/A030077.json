Hence an upper bound for a(n) is the number of compositions of n-1 into floor(n/2) parts, which is A099578(n-2). It appears that the upper bound is attained for prime n. To find a(n), the length of A052558(n-2) paths must be computed. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 09 2007","example":"For n=4 the 3 lengths are: 3 boundary edges (length 3), edge-diagonal-edge (2 + sqrt 2) and diagonal-edge-diagonal (1 + 2sqrt 2). For n=5, the 4 edges of the path may include 0,...,4 diagonals, so a(5)=5.","crossrefs":["Cf.
