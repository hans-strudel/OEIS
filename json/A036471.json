When the common value of sigma is the same for several quadruples, these are then sorted (ascending) by the smallest member. When the smallest members also agree, we go on to the second smallest members, and so on, lexicographically. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Feb 02 2015Of the first 2000 quadruples, there are 78 cases where both the value of sigma, the value of the smallest member (a), and the value of the second smallest member (b) agree with those of the previous quadruple.
