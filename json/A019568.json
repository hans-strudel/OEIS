The partition of the set {k: 0 <= k < 2^(n+1)} into two sets A,B according to the parity of the number of 1s in the binary expansion of k, has the property that Sum_{k in A} p(k) = Sum_{k in B} p(k) for any polynomial p of degree <= n. Equivalently, if e(k) is the Thue-Morse sequence A106400, then Sum_{0 <= k < 2^m} e(k)p(k) = 0 for any polynomial p with deg(p) < m. - _Pietro Majer_, Mar 14 2009","references":["Posting to sci.math Nov 11 1996 by fredh(AT)ix.netcom.com (Fred W.

Since (1-x)^4 divides Q(x), if S is the shift operator on sequences, the operator Q(S) has the fourth discrete difference (I-S)^4 as factor, hence annihilates the sequence of cubes. - _Pietro Majer_, Mar 14 2009","mathematica":"Table[k = 1; found = False; While[s = Range[k]^n; sm = Total[s]; If[EvenQ[sm], sm = sm/2; found = MemberQ[Total /@ Subsets[s], sm]]; ! found, k++]; k, {n, 0, 4}] (* _T.
