E.g.: |T(6,2)| = 144 + 40 = 184 from the partitions of 6 with exactly two odd parts, namely (1,5) and (3,3), with M_2 numbers 144 and 40. Proof via the general Jabotinsky triangle formula for |T(n,k)| using partitions of n into k parts and their M_3 numbers (A036040). Then with the special e.g.f. of the (unsigned) k=1 column, f(x):= arctanh(x), only odd parts survive and the M_3 numbers are changed into the M_2 numbers. For the Knuth reference on Jabotinsky triangles see A039692. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 24 2005 [The first two sentences have been corrected thanks to the comment by _José H. Nieto S._ given below. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 16 2012]|T(n,k)| gives the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} (degree n permutations) with the number of odd cycles equal to k. E.g.: |T(5,3)|= 20 from the 20 degree 5 permutations with cycle structure (.)(.)(...). Proof: Use the cycle index polynomial for the symmetric group S_n (see the M_2 array A036039 or A102189) together with the partition interpretation of |T(n,k)| given above. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 24 2005 [See the following _José H. Nieto S._ correction. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 16 2012]The first sentence of the above comment is inexact, it should be \"|T(n,k)| gives the number of degree n permutations which decompose into exactly k odd cycles\". The number of degree n permutations with k odd cycles (and, possibly, other cycles of even length) is given by A060524. - _José H.
