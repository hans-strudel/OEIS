I. 2p is in the sequence iff 2p+1 is composite (p is not a Sophie Germain prime). II. 4p is in the sequence iff 2p+1 and 4p+1 are composite. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Dec 30 2005Another subset of nontotients consists of the numbers n^2+1 such that n^2+2 is composite. These n are given in A106571. Similarly, let b be 3 or a number such that b=1 (mod 4). For any k>0 such that b^k+2 is composite, b^k+1 is a nontotient. - _T. D. Noe_, Sep 13 2007The Firoozbakht comment can be generalized: Observe that if n is a nontotient and 2n+1 is composite, then 2n is also a nontotient. See A057192 and A076336 for a connection to SierpiÅ„ski numbers. This shows that 271129*2^k is a nontotient for all k>0. - _T. D. Noe_, Sep 13 2007","references":["R. K.
