Here one has no choice, because sigma_i=0 for i>n and fewer than n sigma's would not suffice.But, by Newton's formulas, the field is also given as Q(s_1,...,s_n) where s_i is the i-th power sum, and now one can ask whether some other sequence s_{j_1},...,s_{j_n} (0<j_1<...<j_n) also works.For n=1 the only possibility is clearly s_1, since Q(s_i) = Q(a^i) does not coincide with Q(a) for i>1, but for n=2 one has two possibilities Q(s_1,s_2) or Q(s_1,s_3), since from s_1=a+b and s_3=a^3+b^3 one can reconstruct s_2 = (s_1^3+2s_3)/3s_1.Similarly, for n=3 one has the possibilities (123), (124), (125), and (135) (the formula in the last case is s_2 = (s_1^5+5s_1^2s_3-6s_5)/5(s_1^3-s_3); one can find the corresponding formulas in the other cases easily) and for n=4 there are 7: 1234, 1235, 1236, 1237, 1245, 1247, and 1357.A theorem of Kakutani (I do not know a reference) says that the sequences which occur are exactly the finite subsets of N whose complements are additive semigroups (for instance, the complement of {1,2,4,7} is 3,5,6,8,9,..., which is an closed under addition).This is a really beautiful theorem. I wrote a simple program to count the sets of cardinality n which have the property in question for n = 1, ..., 16. (End)This sequence relates to numerical semigroups, which are basic fundamental objects but little known: A numerical semigroup S < N is defined by being: closed under addition, contains zero and N \\ S is finite.
