Bagula_, Feb 20 2009From _Peter Bala_, Aug 08 2011: (Start)Given a permutation p belonging to the symmetric group S_n, let fix(p) be the number of fixed points of p and sign(p) its parity. The row polynomials R(n,x) have a combinatorial interpretation as R(n,x) = (-1)^n*sum {permutations p in S_n} sign(p)*(-x)^(fix(p)). An example is given below.Note: The polynomials P(n,x) = sum {permutations p in S_n} x^(fix(p)) are the row polynomials of the rencontres numbers A008290. The integral results int {x = 0..n} R(n,x) = n/(n+1) = int {x = 0..-1} R(n,x) lead to the identities sum {p in S_n} sign(p)*(-n)^(1+fix(p))/(1+fix(p)) = (-1)^(n+1)*n/(n+1) = sum {p in S_n} sign(p)/(1+fix(p)).
