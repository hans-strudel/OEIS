Each has a penny. Player 1 passes a penny to player 2, who passes two pennies to player 3, who passes a penny to player 4. Player 4 passes a penny to player 5, who passes two pennies to player 6, who passes a penny to player 7 and so on, players passing 1,2,1,1,2,1,... pennies to the next player who still has some pennies. A player who runs out of pennies drops out of the game and leaves the table. Sequence gives number of players remaining when game reaches periodic state.","references":["Suggested by 58th William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, 1997, Problem A-2."],"links":["<a href=\"http://math.ucsd.edu/~pfitz/pastputnam.html\">Putnam Mathematical Competitions</a>"],"example":"a(10)=4 because 4 players (numbers 4, 6, 9, 10) remain.","keyword":"easy,nonn,nice","offset":"1,4","author":"_Sen-Peng Eu_, Apr 08 2001"}
