V(i) stands for the numerator and denominator of the 2i-th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of sqrt(D).Thus setting n = 3, for instance, we have D = a(3) = 2 and V(1) = [3, 2] so that along with V(0) = [1, 0] recurrence V(i+2) = 6*V(i+1)-V(i) generates [A001333(2k), A000129(2k)]. Similarly, setting n = 9 generates [A023039, A060645], respectively the numerator and denominator of the 2i-th convergent of sqrt{a(9)}, i.e. sqrt{5}. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Feb 26 2002","links":["Ray Chandler, <a href=\"/A033314/b033314.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 2..1001</a>","Eric Weisstein's World of Mathematics, <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PellEquation.html\">Pell Equation.</a>"],"crossrefs":["Cf.
