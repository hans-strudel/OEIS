A deck has n kinds of cards, 2 of each kind. The deck is shuffled and dealt in to n hands with 2 cards each. A match occurs for every card in the j-th hand of kind j. Triangle T(n,k) is the number of ways of achieving exactly k matches (k=0..2n). The probability of exactly k matches is T(n,k)/((2n)!/2^n).Rows are of length 1,3,5,7,... = A005408(n). [Edited by _M.
