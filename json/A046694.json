The first such twin pair is a(184) = a(185) = 483. The indices for a first twin in a pair are listed in A121733. Corresponding twin values are listed in A121734. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Aug 18 2006Set of values of a(n) consists of all integers from 0 to 690. The first a(n) = 0 occur at n = 2*691 - 1 = 1381 that is a prime. Set of numbers n such that a(n) = 0 is a union of all terms of the arithmetic progressions k*p, where p is a prime of the form p = 2m*691 - 1 and k>0 is an integer. Primes of the form p = 2m*691 - 1 are listed in A134671 = {1381,5527,8291,12437,22111,29021,30403,...}. It appears that in a(n) there are strings of consecutive zeros of any length.
