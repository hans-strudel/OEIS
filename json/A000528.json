In the 1-factorizations formulation, these operations are labeling of left side, labeling of right side, permuting the order in which the factors are listed and swapping the left and right sides, respectively. - _Brendan McKay_There are 6108088657705958932053657 isomorphism classes of one-factorizations of $K_{11,11}$. - Petteri Kaski (petteri.kaski(AT)cs.helsinki.fi), Sep 18 2009","references":["CRC Handbook of Combinatorial Designs, 1996, p. 660.","Denes and Keedwell, Latin Squares and Applications, Academic Press 1974."],"links":["A.
