They are also the only nontrivial (z!=0) principal branch solutions of z=W(z^2), W being the Lambert W-function. Though the two values are iterative attractors of the mapping z->log(z), the convergence is rather slow; the precision improves by slightly more than one binary bit every 2.25 iterations (about 7500 iterations are needed to make stable the first 1000 decimal digits). - _Stanislav Sykora_, Jun 07 2015","references":["Wolfram Research, Mathematica, Version 4.1.0.0, Help Browser, under the function FixedPoint."],"links":["Stanislav Sykora, <a href=\"/A059526/b059526.txt\">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..2000</a>"],"example":"z = 0.31813150520476413531265425158766451720351761387139986692237... + 1.33723570143068940890116214319371061253950213846051241887631... *i","mathematica":"RealDigits[ Re[ N[ FixedPoint[ Log, 1 + I, 910], 105]]] [[1]]RealDigits[ N[ Re[ ProductLog[-1]], 105]][[1]] (* _Jean-Fran√ßois Alcover_, Feb 01 2012 *)","prog":"(PARI) z=I;for(k=1,16000,z=log(z));real(z)  \\\\ Using realprecision \\p 2010. - _Stanislav Sykora_, Jun 07 2015","crossrefs":["Imaginary part is A059527.","Cf.
