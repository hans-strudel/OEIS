{"formerly":"","seq":"3,4,5,7,11,17,47,59,71,139,211,251,311,347,457,461","description":"Numbers n such that the repunit of length n (11...11, with n 1's) has exactly 2 prime factors.","comments":"347, 457, 461 and 701 are also terms. The only other possible terms up to 1000 are 263, 311, 509, 557, 617, 647 and 991; repunits of these lengths are known to be composite but the linked sources do not provide their factors. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Mar 11 2003The Yousuke Koide reference now shows repunit of length 263 partially factored, no longer possible candidate for this sequence. - _Ray Chandler_, Sep 06 2005The term 263 has 3 prime factors, 617 has one prime factor and a large composite. For terms between 1000 to 2000, other possible terms are 1117, 1213, 1259, 1291, 1373, 1447, 1607, 1637, 1663, 1669, 1759, 1823, 1949, 1987, 2063 & 2087. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Apr 26 2010All terms are either primes or squares of primes in A004023. In particular, the only composite below a million is 4. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Nov 21 2014","references":["Clifford A.
