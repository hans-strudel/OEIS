A new site is then infected if at least two of its neighbors are infected and an infected site stays infected forever. The set A is said to percolate if eventually the entire grid is infected. A percolating set is said to be minimal if none of its subsets percolate. Answering a question of Bollobas, we show that there exists a minimal percolating set of size 4n^2/33 + o(n^2), but there does not exist one larger than (n + 2)^2/6.\" - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Feb 13 2007For n>=1, the set {A008747(6n+-1)} is the set of numbers of the form a^2+5(a+1)^2 for -inf < a < inf.
