Let d be the Dottie number.  Then P=(d,sin(d)), and d is the slope at P of the sine curve. - _Clark Kimberling_, Oct 07 2011From Ben Branman, Dec 28 2011: (Start)The name \"Dottie\" is of no fundamental mathematical significance since it refers to a particular French professor who--no doubt like many other calculator uses before and after her--noticed that whenever she typed a number into her calculator and hit the cosine button repeatedly, the result always converged to this value.The number is well-known, having appeared in numerous elementary works on algebra already by the late 1880s (e.g., Bertrand 1865, p. 285; Heis 1886, p. 468; Briot 1881, pp. 341-343), and probably much earlier as well. It is also known simply as the cosine constant, cosine superposition constant, iterated cosine constant, or cosine fixed point constant. Arakelian (1981, pp. 135-136; 1995) has used the Armenian small letter ayb (ա, the first letter in the Armenian alphabet) to denote this constant.
