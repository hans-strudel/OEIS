The partitions counted by a(n) correspond to conjugacy classes of optimal order of the symmetric group of n elements : they have no fixed point, their order is the direct product of their cycle lengths and they are not contained in a subgroup of Sym_p for p < n. A123131 gives the maximum order (LCM) reachable by these partitions.","references":["N. J. A.
