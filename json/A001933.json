(Note for example that the 3 X 3 square nonomino is not included, as the axes of symmetry do not coincide with the edges of any squares.)

Note that for polyominoes which have a hole in the center, the center of rotation will be the corner of a square within the hole, rather than being the corner of a square of the polyomino itself.
