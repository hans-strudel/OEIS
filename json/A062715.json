This array, call it M, is obtained by augmenting P^2 with an initial column of 1's on the left.The array has connections with the Bernoulli polynomials B(n,x). The infinitesimal generator S of M is the array such that exp(S) = M. The array S is obtained by augmenting the infinitesimal generator 2*A132440 of P^2 with an initial column [0,1,0,-1/3,0,7/15,...] on the left. The entries in this column, apart from the initial zero, are the cosecant numbers 2^n*B(n,1/2), n>=1. See A001896 and A001897.The array M is also connected with the problem of summing powers of consecutive odd integers. In the array M^n, the entry in position p+1 of the first column is equal to sum {k = 1..n} (2*k-1)^p - see the Example section below.For similar results when the array P, rather than P^2, is augmented with a column of 1's see A135225.(End)From _Peter Bala_, Oct 13 2011: (Start)The first column of the array (I-t*A062715)^-1, I the identity, begins [1/(1-t), t/(1-t)^2, t*(1+t)/(1-t)^3, t*(1+6*t+t^2)/(1-t)^4, ...]. The numerator polynomials, apart from the initial 1, are the type B Eulerian polynomials of A060187 (but with an extra factor of t).The polynomials in t in the first column of the array ((1+t)*I-t*A062715)^-1 are, apart from the initial 1, the row polynomials of A145901 (but again with an extra factor of t).
