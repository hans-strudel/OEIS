Abstract: It is well known since A. J. Kempner's work that the series of the reciprocals of the positive integers whose decimal representation does not contain any digit 9 is convergent. This result was extended by F. Irwin and others to deal with the series of the reciprocals of the positive integers whose decimal representation contains only a limited quantity of each digit of a given nonempty set of digits. Actually, such series are all known to be convergent. Here, letting S^{(r)} (r in N}) denote the series of the reciprocals of the positive integers whose decimal representation contains the digit 9 exactly r times, the impressive result obtained is that S^{(r)} tends to 10 log{10} as r tends to infinity! - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jul 23 2008","references":["W.
