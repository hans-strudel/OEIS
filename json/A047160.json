The primes p and q must be equidistant (distance m >= 0) from n: p = n-m and q = n+m, hence p+q = (n-m)+(n+m) = 2n.Equivalent to Goldbach's Conjecture: for all n >= 2, there are primes p and q equidistant (distance >= 0) from n, where p and q are n when n is prime.If this conjecture is true, then a(n) will never be set to -1.Twin Primes Conjecture: there is an infinity of twin primes.If this conjecture is true, then a(n) will be 1 infinitely often (for which each twin primes pair is (n-1, n+1)).Since there is an infinity of primes, a(n) = 0 infinitely often (for which n is prime).(End)If n is composite, then n and a(n) are coprime, because otherwise n + a(n) would be composite. - _Jason Kimberley_, Sep 03 2011","links":["T.
