It violates almost all my rules. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 08 2000The explanation \"1 stands for the first note in the minor scale, etc.\" is not satisfying. It appears that the current data refers to the full tones in that scale, but this does not allow us to encode correctly half-tones occurring later in the score but which are not part of the C minor scale. It would be more satisfying to record the half-tones, using, e.g., 0=c, 1=c#, 2=d, 3=d#,..., 12=c', -12=C,... - _M. F.
