E.g. five consecutive connected numbers in A029827 are 4087,4089,4095,4369,4471 and corresponding differences are 2,6,274 and 102. Thus the density of connected numbers rises and falls in interval [ 2^(g-1),2^g ].","crossrefs":["Cf. A029827, A029837."],"keyword":"nonn","offset":"1,1","author":"_Labos Elemer_"}
