A deck has n kinds of cards, 3 of each kind. The deck is shuffled and dealt in to n hands with 3 cards each. A match occurs for every card in the j-th hand of kind j. Triangle T(n,k) is the number of ways of achieving exactly k matches (k=0..3n). The probability of exactly k matches is T(n,k)/((3n)!/(3!)^n).Rows have lengths 1,4,7,10,...Analogous to A008290 - _Zerinvary Lajos_, Jun 22 2005","references":["F. N. David and D. E.
