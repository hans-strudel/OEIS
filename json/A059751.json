D. Noe_, Feb 18 2009: Erdős and Pomerance conjectured that the number n+a(n)+1, which \"blocks\" a(n) from becoming larger, is always an odd semiprime. They verified this conjecture up to n=492 and proved it for large n. The numbers n at which n+a(n)+1 increases also appear to be semiprimes.","references":["D. S.
