In other words, here we consider that the trajectory ends if we reach 1.Given that A001065(n) is the sum of the divisors of n which are less than n, we have that the aliquot length A(n) = r-1 where r is the smallest integer such that A001065^r(n) = A001065^s(n) for some s<r. If this never happens (i.e., if r is infinite) then we set a(n) = 0. [Edited by _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 16 2013]In the interval [1,1000] it is not known if the aliquot length is 0 for the numbers 276, 552, 564, 660 and 966.The function sigma = A000203 (and thus A001065 = sigma - id) is defined only on the positive integers and not for 0, so the trajectory ends when 0 is reached. - _M.
