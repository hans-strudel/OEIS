L. Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) in the 19th century.\"To evaluate the determinant of an n X n matrix A, set up a 2 by 2 determinant with entries that equal the determinants of the \"northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast\" (n-1) by (n-1) submatrices of A. Divide this by determinant of the \"central\" (n-2) by (n-2) submatrix of A. If the latter is zero, the problem can be fixed by row interchanges.\"The Dodgson method does better than the standard method of using cofactors and an expansion in terms of a row/column if n is 6 or larger. By this we mean that a fewer number of 2 by 2 determinants need to be calculated. Of course, the method of choice is diagonalization which can be achieved in polynomial time. Dodgson's method runs in exponential time, whereas the \"standard\" method requires one to evaluate n!/2 two by two determinants.\"A beautiful combinatorial proof of Dodgson's result was recently given by Zeilberger and an application is presented by Amdeberhan and Ekhad, where a conjecture of Kuperberg and Propp is proved using Dodgson's formula.\" (End)This is the sequence A(0,1;4,1;1)of the family of sequences [a,b:c,d:k] considered by G.
