In other words, every positive odd integer k is equal to the GCD of d(m^2) and d(m) for some m. To see this, let m = 2^(k^2 - 1) * 3^((k-1)/2). Then d(m) = k^2 * (k+1)/2 and d(m^2) = (2 k^2 - 1) * k. Both of these are divisible by k and (8k-4) d(m) - (2k+1) d(m^2) = k, so the GCD is k. - _Dean Hickerson_, Jun 23 2001","formula":"a(n) = Min[m : GCD[d(m^2), d(m)] = 2n+1].","example":"For n = 7, GCD[d(20736),d(144)] = GCD[45,15] = 15 = 2*7+1.","crossrefs":["Cf.
