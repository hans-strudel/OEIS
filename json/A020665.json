See the OEIS wiki page for further reading. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 08 2014From _Bill McEachen_, Apr 01 2015: (Start) It appears that the values at square pointers will be no more than that of the base pointer. Specifically when the value at the base pointer is even, the value at the square will be 50%. For example, the sequence n=2,4,16 yields a(n)=86,43,19. The sequence n=3,9,81 yields a(n)=68,34,17.Values at other than squares are less obvious. However, at some point, the run of the squares ends, implying remaining nonzero values should indicate either nonsquares or prime entries. (End)Since (n^b)^j = n^(b*j), a(n) >= b*a(n^b); if a(n) is divisible by b then a(n^b) = a(n)/b. - _Robert Israel_, Apr 01 2015","links":["M. F.
