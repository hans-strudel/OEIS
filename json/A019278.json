Then also q = (sigma(s)/s)*(sigma(n)/n) with s = sigma(n). That is, q = abundancy(s)*abundancy(n).So looking at the abundancy of these terms may be interesting. Indeed we see that 459818240 and 51001180160 are actually 3-perfect numbers (A005820); and the reason they are here is that they are coprime to 3. So their sum of divisors are 4-perfect numbers (A027687), yielding q=12.In a similar way, we can see the 5-perfect numbers (A046060) that are coprime to 5, will be terms of this sequence with q=30. There are 20 such numbers, the smallest being 13188979363639752997731839211623940096. (End)From _Michel Marcus_, May 15 2016: (Start)It is also interesting to note that for a(2)=8, s=sigma(8)=15 is also a term. This happens to be the case for chains of several terms in a row:8, 15, 24, 60, 168, 480 with q = 3,4,7,8,9,10;512, 1023, 1536, 4092, 10752, 32736 with q = 3,4,7,8,9,10;29127, 47360, 116508, 331520, 932064, 2983680 with q = 4,7,8,9,13,14;1556480, 3932040, 14008320 with q = 9,13,14;106151936, 251650560, 955367424 with q = 9,13,14;312792480, 1505806848 with q = 19,20;6604416000, 30834059256 with q = 19,20;9623577600, 46566269568 with q = 19,20.When n is a term, we can test if s=sigma(n) is also a term; this way we get 6 more terms: 572941926400, 845734196736, 1422976331052, 4010593484800, 11383810648416, 36095341363200.And the corresponding chains are:173238912000, 845734196736 with q = 19,20;355744082763, 572941926400, 1422976331052, 4010593484800, 11383810648416, 36095341363200 with q = 4,7,8,9,13,14.
