Furthermore, each subsequence from the first to the (n!-1)-th term is palindromic.","comments":"This is lexicographically the ninth of all such Hamiltonian paths through S4.I will try to extend this in some elegant fashion through all S_inf so that the same criteria will hold. There are 466 ways to extend this to S5.","links":["A.
