Scan a from left to right and create an n-permutation by noting the POSITION of the elements as you come to them in order from least to greatest. See example. T(n,k) is the number of sequences that correspond to such a permutation having exactly n-k descents. [From _Geoffrey Critzer_, May 19 2010]","references":["R. L. Graham, D. E. Knuth and O.
