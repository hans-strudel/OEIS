Sequence gives number of distinct n-permutations that result.","formula":"For n>3, a(n) = 2 * F(n+1), with F(n) = A000045(n).","example":"a(4)=10 because we can split the deck as 1|234 then shuffle to get 2134 or 2314, or split as 12|34 and get 3421 1324 1342 3124 3142 or split 123|4 and get 1243, 1423.
