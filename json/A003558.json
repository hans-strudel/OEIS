Adamson_, Sep 20 2011: (Start)a(n) can be determined by the cycle lengths of iterates using x^2 - 2, seed 2*cos 2Pi/N; as shown in the A065941 comment of Sep 06 2011. The iterative map of the logistic equation 4x*(1-x) is likewise chaotic with the same cycle lengths but initiating the trajectory with sin^2 2*Pi/N, N = 2n+1 [Kappraff & Adamson, 2004]. Chaotic terms with the identical cycle lengths can be obtain by applying Newton's method to i = sqrt(-1) [Strang, also Kappraff and Adamson, 2003], resulting in the morphism for the cot 2Pi/N trajectory: (x^2-1)/2x. (End)Roots of signed n-th row A054142 polynomials are chaotic with respect to the operation (-2, x^2), with cycle lengths a(n). Example: starting with a root to x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 1 = 0; (2 + 2*cos 2Pi/N = 3.24697...); we obtain the trajectory (3.24697...-> 1.55495...-> .198062...); the roots to the polynomial with cycle length 3 matching a(3) = 3. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Sep 21 2011From _Gary W. Adamson_, Aug 13 2012: (Start)[Hilton & Pedersen] The Binary Quasi-order Theorem: If the symbol (I) is reduced (i.e. gcd(b, a(i) = 1) and contracted (i.e., the symbol involves no repeated a(i)), then the quasi-order of 2 mod b is k = Sum {i=1...r} k(i) and in fact 2^k == (-1)^r mod b. The symbol (*) is:b [a(1),...a(2),...a(r)]..[k(l),...k(2)....k(4)].For example with b = 41:41 [1,...5,...9]...[3....2....5]where the sum of terms in the bottom row = 10 = a(20). The calculation is (b - a(i) = 2^(k(i) * a(i + 1). Alternatively, terms in the bottom row are highest powers of k, 2^k maximal where we start (41 - 1), then extract 3 powers of 3, recording the remainder of 5 in a(2). Repeat: (41 - 5) = 36, extracting two powers of 2 placing \"2\" in k(2), with the remainder of 9 as a(3).n. With a \"1\" in the top row, the numbers of entries in the rows (j) are A179480(n+1) with sum of bottom row terms = A03358(n). The example shows that k = 10 = a(20); r = 3 = A179480(21), that the quasi-order of 2 mod 41 is 10 and further, that 2^10 ==-1 mod 41 so that 41 divides (2^10 + 1). (End)From _Gary W. Adamson_, Aug 15 2012: (Start)The number of possible coaches for b is appropriately called the Coach number of b by [Pedersen et al. - cf. A135303] and is recorded in A135303. For example, b = 17 has two possible coaches:17 [1], [3, 7, 5],...[4], [1, 1, 2],indicated by A135303(8) = 2. Sum of terms in the bottom row = k = a(8) = 4. (End).From _Gary W. Adamson_, Aug 16 2012: (Start)From the [Hilton & Pederson] reference:provide the case of b = 641 = a(320) as illustrating a factor of a Fermat number. The coach:641: [1, 5, 159, 241, 25, 77, 141, 125, 129].....[7, 2,...1,...4,..3,..2,...2,...2,...9]shows that the sum of terms in the bottom row (k) = 32. Thus a(320) = 32. The numbers of entries in each row = j = 9 (odd), so that A179480(341) = 9. When k is of the form 2^n, and j is odd (i.e., 32 in this case, j odd); b divides a Fermat number. The example shows that 2^32 == -1 mod 641 or 641 divides (2^32 + 1), the Fermat number 4294967297. (End)From _Gary W. Adamson_, Aug 17 2012: (Start)Note that a(42), b = 85, the Quasi-order symbol is:85 [ 1, 21]...[ 2,..6]with k = 8, r = 2. The corollary 2^k == (-1)^r mod b implies that 85 divides (2^8 - 1) or 3 * 85 = 255. r is even in this case, so 85 does not divide a Fermat number. (End)From _Juhani Heino_, Oct 26 2015: (Start)Start a sequence with numbers 1 and n. For next numbers, add previous numbers going backwards until the sum is even. Then the new number is sum/2. I conjecture that the sequence returns to 1,n and a(n) is the cycle length.For example: 1,7,4,2,1,7,... so a(7) = 4.1,6,3,5,4,2,1,6,... so a(6) = 6. (End)From _Juhani Heino_, Nov 06 2015: (Start)Proof of the above conjecture: Let n = -1/2; thus 2n + 1 = 0, so operations are performed mod (2n + 1). When the member is even, it is divided by 2. When it is odd, multiply by n, so effectively divide by -2. This is all well-defined in the sense that new members m are 1 <= m <= n. Now see what happens starting from an odd member m. The next member is -m/2. As long as there are even members, divide by 2 and end up with an odd -m/(2^k). Now add all the members starting with m. The sum is m/(2^k). It's divided by 2, so the next member is m/(2^(k+1)). That is the same as (-m/(2^k))/(-2), as with the definition.So actually start from 1 and always divide by 2, although the sign sometimes changes. Eventually 1 is reached again. The chain can be traversed backwards and then 2^(cycle length) == +- 1 (mod 2n + 1).To conclude, we take care of a(0): sequence 1,0 continues with zeros and never returns to 1. So let us declare that cycle length 0 means unavailable.
