J.

If w is a base-p, length-n Lyndon word then f=g^w (where w is interpreted as a radix-p number) has an irreducible characteristic polynomial C (over GF(p)) and, if gcd(w,p^n-1)==1 then C is primitive.(End)","maple":"A027385 := proc(n) numtheory[phi](3^n-1)/n; end proc:","prog":"(PARI) a(n) = eulerphi(3^n-1)/n; /* _Joerg Arndt_, Aug 25 2011 */","keyword":"nonn","offset":"1,2","author":"_Frank Ruskey_"}
