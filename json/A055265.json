Reply from _Robert G. Wilson v_, May 27 2009: The answer is almost certainly yes, on probabilistic grounds.It appears that this is the limit of the rows of A051237. That those rows do approach a limit seems certain, and given that that limit exists, that this sequence is the limit seems even more certain, but no proof is obvious for either assertion. - _Robert G.
