Most of them have only small prime factors.The first three terms are in A007691 (multiply perfect numbers) but 950976 is not since Sigma_1/x is not an integer.sigma_0(n) is the number of divisors of n (A000005).sigma_1(n) is the sum of the divisors of n [same as sigma(n)] (A000203).","formula":"Average divisor=a=Sigma_1(x)/Sigma_0(x) is not an integer but x/a is.","example":"x=28, Sigma_0=6, Sigma_1=56, a=S1/S0=9.33 is not an integer but x/a=3 is; x=950976, a=2958592/84=3521.33 but x/a=27 is integral.","crossrefs":["In A001599 but not in A003601.
