Both sequences have every finite binary word as a factor; in fact, essentially the same proof works for both sequences.Sutner continues: All words of length k seem to appear in the first 2^{k+2} bits. This is true for the first billion bits of the sequence, but no proof is known. The main open problem is whether the limiting density of 0's is 1/2. It seems to require a large amount of effort just to show that it is bounded away from 0, never mind some of the more exotic properties of the sequence (see the Sutner reference).Start with a single bit 0. If the first n bits U(n) = a(1)a(2)...a(n) have already been chosen, let v be the longest suffix of U(n) that already appears in U(n-1). Find the last occurrence of v in U(n-1) and let b the bit that occurs immediately after. Then a(n+1) is the complement of b. (The entry gives the bits as 1's and 2s instead of 0's and 1's - compare A038219) - _Joshua Zucker_, Aug 11 2006","references":["A. Ehrenfeucht and J.
